title: "Collect"
description: "Efficiently gather multiple pieces of information from callers in a natural, conversational manner"
---

The Collect block lets your agent gather multiple pieces of information back-to-back, like name, phone number, email, order number, etc.\
Think of it as a **mini-form inside a conversation**. The agent asks each question, stores the answers as variables, and only moves forward once all required details are captured.

## When to Use the Collect Block

Use it when you need to gather **several related inputs in a sequence**, such as:

- Customer contact details (name, phone, email)
- Appointment information (date, time, location)
- Intake forms (lead qualification, support triage, signup flow)

Instead of stacking multiple Ask Blocks, Collect handles them in one step, cleaner flows, fewer branches, more natural speech.

## How it Works

- You define the fields you want to collect.
- Phonely automatically asks the questions conversationally.
- If the caller already gave the info earlier, the agent confirms instead of repeating.
- Once completed, each answer becomes a variable you can use anywhere in the workflow.

## Setup  - Two Ways to Build

### Generate with AI

1. Add a **Collect** block to your flow.
2. In the text box, simply describe what you want collected:

   ```
   Gather the caller's name, email, and phone number.
   ```

  alt="Collect Block In Phonely Pn"
  style={{ width:"85%" }}
/>

3. Click **Generate with AI**.
4. Review the generated questions → edit if needed.
5. Click **Done**.

Great for quick intake flows or prototyping.

### Build Manually

1. Add a **Collect** block.
2. Click **Build Manually**.
3. For each item you want to collect:

| Field             | What you enter                                                                              |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Variable Name** | The internal name used later (e.g., `customer_name`)                                        |
| **Type**          | Text, Phone, Email, Number, Date, URL, Regex, Enum, etc.                                    |
| **Question**      | The instruction for the AI (e.g., "Ask the caller for their name")                          |
| **Required**      | When enabled, AI will ensure this information is collected before moving to the next block. |
| **Confirm**       | When enabled, the AI will confirm the variable with the caller before proceeding.           |
| **Spell Back**    | When enabled, the AI will spell out the confirmed information letter by letter.             |

4. Click **Add Question** for more fields.
5. Save \> **Done**

Manual mode is ideal if you want strict formatting, specific wording, or typed inputs.

## Example Form Setup

| Variable Name | Type  | Question                       |
| :------------ | :---- | :----------------------------- |
| name          | Text  | Ask the caller for their name  |
| phone         | Phone | Request contact phone number   |
| reason        | Text  | Ask why they are calling today |

Once completed, you’ll have variables like:

```
{name}, {phone}, {reason}
```

Use them to personalize responses, perform lookups, send follow-ups, or pass into APIs.

## Using Collected Data Later

You can reference collected values anywhere using **@variable_name**.

Examples:

- Talk block → `Nice to meet you, @name!`
- API request → Send payload containing @phone
- CRM logging → Store @reason for support ticket routingAdvanced Options
- **Validation & Format Control**\
  Regex & custom types allow enforcing patterns (emails, numbers, state codes).
- **Call Outcome Tagging**\
  Add tags for reporting, funnels, A/B testing, analytics.

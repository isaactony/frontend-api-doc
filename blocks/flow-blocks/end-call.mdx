title: "End Call"
description: "Gracefully terminate the call and perform any necessary cleanup actions"

The End Call block is used to gracefully close a call with the caller. It ensures the flow ends naturally, often with a polite goodbye message or closing statement. This block can also optionally send a follow-up SMS message or tag the call outcome for reporting and analytics.

It’s typically placed at the end of a call flow or at points where no further interaction is required (e.g., when the system finishes collecting or processing information).

## Key Purposes

- To end the conversation naturally with a final spoken message.
- To automatically generate or define a goodbye message using context.
- To trigger an SMS follow-up message that mirrors the call’s tone.
- To label and track call outcomes using tags for reporting or integration purposes.
- Call Summary: Generate comprehensive call summary.
- Outcome Tagging: Set custom outcome tags for analytics.
- Post-Call Actions: Trigger webhooks or data logging.

## When to Use the End Call Block

Use this block in scenarios such as:

- Wrapping up a completed interaction (e.g., after confirming an appointment or providing requested info).
- Ending failed or fallback paths (e.g., when no valid input is received).
- Closing flows after conditional routing, such as when eligibility or verification fails.
- Finishing conversations with a personalized or dynamic closing message.

## Step-by-Step Configuration

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the End Call Message">
    This message is the final thing your caller will hear before the call disconnects.

    You can choose from two modes:

    #### **Option 1: Promptable Message**

    - Use AI to **generate a goodbye message** automatically based on conversation context.
    - The model analyzes what has been said and creates a natural, polite closing line.
    - Example prompt:

      > _“Generate an appropriate goodbye message based on the conversation context to be spoken immediately before ending the call. The user will not say anything after you speak.”_

    Best for adaptive flows where closing messages depend on the situation.

    #### **Option 2: Fixed Message**

    - Write your own static closing line.
    - Example:

      > “Thank you for calling. Have a great day!”

    _Best for consistent, predefined call closings._
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Outcome Tagging">
    This allows you to tag the call with **keywords** that describe its result (e.g., _completed_, _failed_verification_, _voicemail_, _no_response_).

    **Example usage:**

    - `completed`
    - `lead_collected`
    - `support_ticket_closed`

    Helps filter or analyze call outcomes later in analytics dashboards.

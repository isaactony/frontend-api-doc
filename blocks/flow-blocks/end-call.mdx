### **Overview**

The End Call block is used to gracefully close a call with the caller. It ensures the flow ends naturally, often with a polite goodbye message or closing statement. This block can also optionally send a follow-up SMS message or tag the call outcome for reporting and analytics.

It’s typically placed at the end of a call flow or at points where no further interaction is required (e.g., when the system finishes collecting or processing information).

## Key Purposes

- To end the conversation naturally with a final spoken message.
- To automatically generate or define a goodbye message using context.
- To trigger an SMS follow-up message that mirrors the call’s tone. 
- To label and track call outcomes using tags for reporting or integration purposes.
- Call Summary: Generate comprehensive call summary.
- Outcome Tagging: Set custom outcome tags for analytics.
- Post-Call Actions: Trigger webhooks or data logging.

## When to Use the End Call Block

Use this block in scenarios such as:

- Wrapping up a completed interaction (e.g., after confirming an appointment or providing requested info). 
- Ending failed or fallback paths (e.g., when no valid input is received).
- Closing flows after conditional routing, such as when eligibility or verification fails.
- Finishing conversations with a personalized or dynamic closing message.

## Step-by-Step Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the End Call Block">
    1. In your flow builder, click the **“+”** icon at the point where you want to end the conversation.
    2. Under **Flow Actions**, select **End Call**.
    3. The block will appear with a clear label and an icon representing a phone hang-up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the End Call Message">
    This message is the final thing your caller will hear before the call disconnects.

    You can choose from two modes:

    #### **Option 1: Promptable Message**

    - Use AI to **generate a goodbye message** automatically based on conversation context.
    - The model analyzes what has been said and creates a natural, polite closing line.
    - Example prompt:

      > “Generate an appropriate goodbye message based on the conversation context to be spoken immediately before ending the call. The user will not say anything after you speak.”

    _Best for adaptive flows where closing messages depend on the situation._

    #### **Option 2: Fixed Message**

    - Write your own static closing line.
    - Example:

      > “Thank you for calling. Have a great day!”

    _Best for consistent, predefined call closings._

  <Step title="Configure Advanced Settings">
    Click the **Advanced Settings** dropdown to unlock more control options.

    #### **1. SMS Message Prompt**

    Use this if you want Phonely to also send a **follow-up SMS** that mirrors the voice message.\
    This can confirm the conversation or summarize next steps.

    **How it works:**

    - The system rephrases your end call message into a natural text tone.
    - Example prompt:

      > “Rephrase the following message from a voice conversation to be more appropriate for a text conversation, while keeping the same meaning and sentiment.”

    _Useful for flows where follow-ups or confirmations are needed after a call ends._

    #### **2. Call Outcome Tagging**

    This allows you to tag the call with **keywords** that describe its result (e.g., _completed_, _failed_verification_, _voicemail_, _no_response_).

    **Example usage:**

    - `completed`
    - `lead_collected`
    - `support_ticket_closed`

    _Helps filter or analyze call outcomes later in analytics dashboards._

The **Transfer Call** block lets your agent seamlessly hand off a live call to another person, department, or fallback destination. Phonely’s updated transfer flow dramatically simplifies call routing by replacing large, branching, hard-to-manage flows with a single intelligent block that can handle warm transfers, cold transfers, failover logic, caller triage, and on-hold experiences—all in one place.

This guide walks you through everything you can do inside the updated **Transfer Call** block, how it works, and how to set it up step-by-step.

## Why the New Transfer Flow Matters

Before this update, businesses had to create giant spider-web flows just to transfer a caller to the right person. A typical setup looked like:

- Ask the caller who they want
- Route them manually to different branches (Dwight → branch A, Michael → branch B, Pam → branch C…)
- Add fallback logic for every branch (e.g., voicemail → retry → next agent)
- Repeat this for every destination.

This resulted in huge, messy workflows.

The new transfer block condenses ALL of this into one simple module:

- Add multiple destiantions.
- Automatically triage callers with AI.
- Automatically retry alternative numbers if one doesn’t pick up.
- Choose warm transfer or cold transfer.
- Customize the caller’s hold experience.
- Set advanced rules like tagging, timeout durations, and human-answered outcomes.

Instead of 30+ blocks, you now need **one**.

## How the Transfer Call Block Works

The Transfer Call block has three main sections:

1. **Setup:** Choose warm or cold transfer.
2. **On Transfer:** Add destinations, conditions, messages, and failover behavior.
3. **Connection Experience:** Customize what happens while the caller waits and after the call connects.      

Let’s walk through each part in detail.

## Setup - Choose the Type of Transfer

At the Setup step, you decide which transfer style your agent will perform.

### Cold Transfer

The agent transfers the caller immediately with **no introduction**.\
Best for:

- Quick internal routing.
- When the person receiving the call does not need context.

### Warm Transfer

The agent briefly introduces the caller and shares context before completing the transfer.\
Best for:

- Customer support escalations.
- Sales handoffs.
- Complex or high-value callers.

Selecting the correct transfer type determines how Phonely behaves when initiating the handoff.

## On Transfer

This section is the heart of the transfer flow. Here, you can define exactly how Phonely determines who to transfer to and in what order.

### Adding Transfer Destinations

Each destination includes:

- **Condition**: keywords such as _“support,” “sales,” “billing”_ that trigger this route. For example if the caller says support or Michael use this destination.
- **Phone Number**: the number Phonely will dial.
- **Pre-Transfer Message**: the message the agent says before transferring (e.g., _“Let me connect you to Pam.”_)
- **Failover Toggle**: enables automatic retry if the call goes to voicemail or isn’t answered.

You can add as many destinations as you need. For example:

1. Destination 1 → Lisa
2. Destination 2 → Michael
3. Destination 3 → Dwight
4. Destination 4 → Pam

Phonely’s AI handles the decision-making automatically—no need to build complex “if caller says X” branches manually.

## Failover Routing (Automatic Retry Logic)

Failover is one of the most powerful features.

When enabled, Phonely:

1. Tries the first number.
2. If no one picks up → moves to the next.
3. Repeats until someone answers.
4. If all fail → exits the block, allowing you to play a fallback message.

  style={{ width:"75%" }}
/>

Example:

- Try Pam
- If Pam doesn’t pick up → call Michael
- If Michael doesn’t pick up → call Dwight
- If Dwight doesn’t pick up → call Jim
- If nobody picks up → agent returns to flow (e.g., “Sorry, no one is available right now.”)

All this happens automatically with a simple toggle.

## Customize the Caller’s On-Hold Experience

When the agent starts the transfer, the caller may need to wait briefly. Phonely lets you design this experience with three modes:

**On Hold Chat**

Phonely continues talking to the customer while completing the transfer.

**On Hold Music**

Phonely plays hold music with periodic reminder messages such as:\
_“Thanks for holding. We're still connecting you.”_

You can set:

- **Reminder message**
- **Reminder frequency (seconds)**

**Both (Chat + Music)**

Phonely mixes live conversation with hold music for a more dynamic waiting experience.

## When Connection Is Established

Once the transfer connects to a human or voicemail, you can define advanced behaviors:

### Warm Transfer Attempt Duration

How long Phonely should attempt the warm introduction before switching to cold transfer.

**Detect who answered:** When enabled, Phonely will detect if a person, voicemail, or IVR answered before proceeding. When disabled, Phonely immediately speaks after detecting any audio.

**Detection timeout:** The maximum time allowed for the other end to speak before being detected as an IVR, voicemail, or a person.

**Message to caller (inbound):** After detecting a person on the line, this message is played to the inbound caller before transferring them to the outbound destination.

**Message to recipient (outbound):** After detecting a person on the line, this message is played to the outbound destination before connecting the inbound caller to them.

**Post transfer message:** After connecting the inbound caller to the outbound destination, this message is played to both parties before the agent disconnects.

**Warm transfer duration:** The maximum duration in seconds that Phonely will attempt to complete the warm transfer.

### Call Outcome Tagging

Automatically tag the call based on:

- Transfer result
- Destination
- Human-answered detection

This is ideal for reporting, analytics, and CRM syncing.

## Putting It All Together: Example Workflow

**Scenario:** Caller wants to reach someone in the support team.

**Setup:**  Choose **Warm Transfer**.

### On Transfer

Add destinations:

1. **Pam**
   - Number: +1…
   - Pre-transfer message: “Let me connect you to Pam.”
   - Enable failover
2. Michael: Number: +1…
3. Dwight: Number: +1…
4. Jim: Number: +1…

  style={{ width:"63%" }}
/>

### Hold Experience

Use **On Hold Music**

- Reminder message: “Thanks for holding, we’re still connecting you.”
- Reminder every 20 seconds

### Connection Behavior

- Warm Transfer Attempt Duration: 45 seconds.
- Add call outcome tags.

## Why This Is a Game-Changer

The updated transfer experience lets you:

- Build advanced routing in minutes instead of hours
- Reduce workflow complexity
- Simplify maintenance
- Improve caller experience
- Use AI triage instead of manual branching
- Automatically retry fallback numbers
- Personalize the hold experience
- Track transfer outcomes more accurately

It’s cleaner, more scalable, more intuitive, and far more powerful.

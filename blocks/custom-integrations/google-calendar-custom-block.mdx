The Custom Google Calendar block lets you set up an entire appointment-booking workflow in just a few clicks. Instead of manually creating multiple blocks and connecting them together, this block bundles the full appointment flow for you:

- **Get Availability**
- **Select Appointment Slot**
- **Make Appointment**

This makes appointment scheduling fast to set up, even for non-technical users, while still allowing complete customization if needed.

## Add the Custom Google Calendar Block

1. Open your Flow.
2. Click any **\+** connector to add a new block.
3. Under **Custom Actions**, select: Google Calendar (Custom Google Calendar).

  style={{ width:"73%" }}
/>

This adds a single block containing the full appointment workflow.

The block includes two output paths:

- **Success:** Appointment successfully created.
- **Fail:** Calendar error, missing info, or scheduling failure.

## Configure the Custom Google Calendar Block

After selecting the **Custom Google Calendar** action and connecting your Google account, the **Configure** tab allows you to define how appointments should be created. This block comes pre-wired with all logic needed to fetch availability, present options to the caller, and book the selected slot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \
Your job is simply to fill in basic scheduling details.

### **1. Duration**

Define how long each appointment slot should be.

Examples you can enter: `15m, 30m, or 1h 30m etc`

This value determines how each time slot is generated and displayed to the caller.2. Event Title

Enter the title that should appear on the Google Calendar event.

Examples:

- **Consultation Call**
- **Demo Appointment**
- **Therapy** **Session**.
- **Onboarding Meeting**

This is what both you and the caller will see on the calendar invite.

### 2. Event Description

Add optional additional details that should appear inside the calendar event.

### 3. Availability Schedule

Set which days and hours callers are allowed to book.

Each day includes:

\*\*Day Toggle: \*\*Enable or disable booking for that day (e.g., disable weekends).

\*\*Time Ranges: \*\*For each enabled day, you can define one or more availability windows:

Example:

- `9:00 am to 12:00 pm`
- `1:00 pm to 5:00 pm`

Options per day:

- **Clock icon:** quickly adjust time
- **✕**  to  remove the current window
- **\+**  to add another window (useful for breaks, split shifts, etc.).

Phonely will automatically:

- Check your Google Calendar for conflicts
- Only offer callers times that fall within these defined ranges
- Generate slots using the Duration you defined earlier

### 4. Click Done

Once your duration, title, description, and weekly schedule are set:

Click **Done** Your Google Calendar block is now fully configured and ready to handle booking automatically during live calls.

## Edit the Block Internally

If you want full control, custom prompts, more conditions, storing the slots, or adjusting logic, you can turn the block into an editable group.

### How to Edit the Block

1. Click the **⋮ menu** on the Google Calendar block.
2. Select **Edit**.

<img
  src="/assets/edit-google-calendar-block.png"
  alt="Edit Google Calendar Block Pn"

  style={{ width:"90%" }}
/>

The block expands into a full workflow group containing:

- **Collect Info**
- **Get Availability**
- **Select Appointment Slot**

  <img
    src="/assets/edit-calendar-block.png"
    alt="Edit Calendar Block Pn"
    title="Edit Calendar Block Pn"
    style={{ width:"92%" }}
  />

You can now:

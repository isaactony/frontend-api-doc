## **What Are Custom Actions?**

Custom Actions allow you to package a series of connected blocks—for example, prompts, logic branches, and API requests - into a single reusable block.\
Once created, you can reuse this action across multiple call flows, share it with your organization, or even publish it to the marketplace.    

Think of a Custom Action as a mini reusable workflow inside your larger flow. It behaves like a single block but contains its own inner logic, inputs, and outputs.

## **Why Custom Actions Matter**

- **Reusability:** Build a workflow once (e.g., appointment scheduling, lead collection, verification) and reuse it across multiple flows.
- **Consistency:** Ensure teams follow the same steps and structure for repeated processes.
- **Scalability:** Share standard actions (like “Verify Customer Identity”) across teams and departments.
- **Maintainability:** Update logic in one plac, changes automatically propagate to all flows using that action.

## **Key Concepts to Understand**

### **1. Inputs**

Inputs are data values passed into the Custom Action from the parent flow.\
For example, if your action needs a caller’s name or a preferred appointment time, you mark these fields as _customizable inputs_.

You decide which fields are configurable by users when they add the action to their flows.

### **2. Output Paths**

Each Custom Action can have **multiple output paths** — these define how the parent flow continues after the action finishes.

Common examples:

- **Success** — everything worked correctly.
- **Fail/Error** — an issue occurred.
- **Not Interested** — the caller declined or ended the process.

When used in a flow, these appear as labeled connection points under the action block, allowing you to branch logic naturally.

### **3. Publishing**

Once a Custom Action is built, you can:

- **Save as Draft** — available only in your current flow (for testing).
- **Publish to Organization** — share it across your team’s workspace.
- **Publish to Marketplace** — share publicly for others to use.

 Each publish option asks you to **choose which fields will be customizable** for users when they add this Custom Action to their call flows.

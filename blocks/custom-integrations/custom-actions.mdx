## **What Are Custom Actions?**

Custom Actions allow you to package a series of connected blocks—for example, prompts, logic branches, and API requests - into a single reusable block.\
Once created, you can reuse this action across multiple call flows, share it with your organization, or even publish it to the marketplace.

Think of a Custom Action as a mini reusable workflow inside your larger flow. It behaves like a single block but contains its own inner logic, inputs, and outputs.

## **Why Custom Actions Matter**

- **Reusability:** Build a workflow once (e.g., appointment scheduling, lead collection, verification) and reuse it across multiple flows.
- **Consistency:** Ensure teams follow the same steps and structure for repeated processes.
- **Scalability:** Share standard actions (like “Verify Customer Identity”) across teams and departments.
- **Maintainability:** Update logic in one plac, changes automatically propagate to all flows using that action.

## **Building a Custom Action (Appointment Example)**

Let’s build a **Make Appointment** Custom Action that collects a preferred time, checks availability, and books an appointment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from Your Flow" titleSize="h3">
    1. Open an existing call flow (e.g., your appointment scheduling flow).
    2. Click the **＋ button** under any existing block.
    3. Select **Build a Custom Action**.\
       A **purple editor window** opens — this is your custom action workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Blocks to Your Custom Action" titleSize="h3">
    Inside the purple area (your Custom Action workspace), you can start building just like you would in a regular flow.

    - Click the **＋ button below the Start node** to open the block selector, then choose any block you want to add — for example, **Talk**, **Collect**, **API Request**, or **Send Email**.
    - Alternatively, you can **drag blocks into the purple area** from an existing flow.

    <Tip>
      When you drag a block into a Custom Action, it becomes part of that action’s internal logic. This means it is disconnected from any nodes outside the group.

      Only the designated output nodes (e.g., Success, Error) can connect outside the Custom Action to the rest of your main flow.
    </Tip>
    Inside the purple area, you can drag and connect blocks just like a normal flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Example: Configuring an Appointment Custom Action " titleSize="h3">
    Let’s walk through how to configure a **Custom Action** that handles appointment scheduling for a legal office.\
    In this example, the goal is to let your AI agent collect the client’s preferred time, check availability, and book a consultation slot automatically.

    #### **Connect an API Request Block**

    Next, you’ll connect to your firm’s booking system or calendar API to check available slots.

    - Click the **＋ button** under your Collect block and select **API Request**.
    - In the configuration panel:
      - Method:  `GET`
      - Endpoint
      - Headers: include your `Content-Type` (e.g., `application/json`) and `apiKey`
      - Body Parameters

        ```
        {
          "startTime": "{{collected.startTime}}",
          "endTime": "{{collected.endTime}}",
          "attorneyId": "12345"
        }
        
        ```
      - You can reference any collected variables using double curly braces `{{ }}`.

    This request checks available appointment slots for the specified time range.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer Available Time Slots" titleSize="h3">
    After retrieving availability, add a **Talk** block to read back available slots to the caller.

    Example prompt:

    > “I found two available slots — tomorrow at 10 AM and Thursday at 2 PM. Which one would you prefer?”

    - If the caller chooses a time, capture their response with another **Collect** block (e.g., `preferredSlot`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Book the Appointment" titleSize="h3">
    Next, add a second **API Request** block to confirm the booking:

    - **Endpoint**
    - **Method:** `POST`
    - **Body Example:**

      ```
      {
        "name": "{{collected.name}}",
        "email": "{{collected.email}}",
        "selectedSlot": "{{collected.preferredSlot}}"
      }
      
      ```

    If the booking is successful, the API will return a confirmation response with details like `bookingId` or `meetingLink`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Output Nodes" titleSize="h3">
    Output nodes define how your **Custom Action** communicates results back to the main flow.\
    They act as exit points - determining what happens once your action finishes, whether it succeeds, fails, or the caller ends the process.

    **Understanding Output Nodes**

    Each output path represents a possible outcome of your action. For example:

    - **Success:** The action completed successfully. i.e The appointment was booked and confirmed.
    - **Fail:** Something went wrong during the process. i.e The booking API request failed or returned an error.
    - **Not Interested:** The caller declined to proceed. i.e The client decided not to book or continue with the call.

    These output paths let you control what the AI should do next, ensuring that every scenario is handled gracefully.

    **Adding Output Nodes**

    1. Click any empty area inside the purple Custom Action box (the group area).
    2. The **Global Settings** panel will slide in from the right side.
    3. Under **Output Paths**, you’ll see existing nodes (e.g., _Success_, _Fail_, _Not Interested_).
    4. To create a new one, click **➕ Add Output Path**, then enter a name - for example, _Escalate_ or _Reschedule_.
    5. Click **Done** to save your changes.

    Once saved, each output path will appear as a small circle at the bottom of the purple Custom Action box, ready to connect to the next step in your flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to End Call and Post-Call Actions" titleSize="h3">
    Once your appointment logic is complete and all outcome paths are defined, you need to connect your Custom Action to the End Call block and any post-call actions that should run after the conversation finishes.\
    This ensures a clean and professional call experience for both your AI agent and the client.

    **Add the End Call Block**

    At the bottom of your flow, click the **＋ button** and select **End Call**.\
    This block finalizes the interaction once all other actions have run.

    You can customize the closing message, for example:

    > “Thank you for scheduling with Smith & Associates. We’ll see you at your confirmed time. Have a great day!”

    **Link Each Output Path to Its Next Step**

    Make sure every outcome path from your Custom Action connects to the appropriate block:

    | **Output Path**    | **Typical Connection**                          | **Example Action**                                                        |
    | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Success**        | End Call\> **Send SMS** or **Send Email**       | “Your consultation is confirmed for Thursday at 2 PM.”                    |
    | **Error**          | \> **Escalate to Support** or **Transfer Call** | Route the caller to a live receptionist if booking fails.                 |
    | **Not Interested** | \> **End Call**                                 | Politely close the call: “Alright, no problem — thank you for your time.” |

    These connections ensure that **each scenario is gracefully handled** without leaving the caller in an unfinished state.

    **Add Optional Post-Call Actions**

    If you want to follow up or log the appointment automatically, add post-call blocks:

    - **Send Email:** Send an internal summary to your legal assistant or client.
    - **Send SMS:** Send a text reminder or confirmation link.
    - **API Request:** Log the appointment into your CRM or case-management system.
    - **Code Block:** Run custom logic — for example, update case status or trigger automation in another tool.

    Once all nodes are connected and fields configured, your Custom Action for appointment booking is complete.\
    In the next section, we’ll cover **how to publish** your Custom Action to your organization or the Phonely Marketplace so it can be reused by others.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publishing Your Custom Action">
    Once your Custom Action is complete and tested, the next step is to **publish** it — either for private testing, internal team use, or public sharing. Publishing determines who can access, reuse, and configure the action in other call flows.

    #### **Accessing the Publish Options**

    To begin publishing:

    1. Click the **⋯ (three vertical dots)** at the **top-right corner** of the purple Custom Action area.
    2. From the dropdown menu, select one of the following options:

    | **Option**                  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                     |
    | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Save as Draft**           | Keeps the Custom Action private to your current flow. Ideal for ongoing testing or early prototypes.                                            |
    | **Publish to Organization** | Shares the Custom Action with your team members. Everyone in your organization can add it to their own call flows and update to newer versions. |
    | **Publish to Marketplace**  | Submits the action for public review and distribution, making it available to all users on Phonely.                                             |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Customizable Fields">
    After selecting a publish option, Phonely will prompt you to **configure fields**.\
    This step defines which variables other users can edit when they use your Custom Action in their own flows.

    1. The **Configure Fields** window opens automatically.\
       Here you’ll see all **available nodes**, such as headers and query parameters, listed on the left panel.
    2. Check the boxes next to the parameters that you want users to customize — for example:
    3. On the right side, Phonely shows editable text fields labeled:\
       _“User will enter value here.”_\
       This indicates that the selected parameter will be visible and configurable by others.
    4. Click **Next** to continue once you’ve chosen all relevant fields.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalize the Integration details and Submit">
    After configuring fields, you’ll move to the **Finalize Custom Action** window.\
    This is where you define how your integration will appear to others.

    1. **Integration Name:**\
       Choose an existing integration or create a new one.
    2. **Description:**\
       Provide a clear summary of what your Custom Action does.
    3. **Icon:**\
       Select an icon to represent your Custom Action (e.g., a purple grid or custom graphic).
    4. **Action Name:**\
       Enter a short, clear title for the action.
    5. Click **Submit** to finalize and publish.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm and Manage Versions" titleSize="h3">
    After submission, you’ll receive a confirmation message indicating that your Custom Action has been successfully created or updated.

    Depending on your chosen option:

    - **Draft:** Appears only within your current project.
    - **Organization:** Appears in your team’s shared action library.
    - **Marketplace:** Submitted for review by Phonely’s moderation team before public listing.

    You can always return to the **⋯ menu** to:

    - Update the action
    - Edit metadata (name, description)
    - Re-publish or retract from the organization or marketplace
  </Step>
  <Step title="New Step">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Step 7 — Editing and Versioning**

To make changes:

1. Hover over your Custom Action block.
2. Click the **⋮ (three dots)** menu → **Edit**.
3. Modify your internal blocks, configuration, or outputs as needed.
4. Save changes — Phonely automatically creates a new version (e.g., “Private – v2”).

Team members can then update their flows to the latest version.

---

### **Step 8 — Using the Custom Action in Other Flows**

Once published:

1. Open any flow.
2. Click **＋ Add Block**.
3. Search for your action name (e.g., “Make Appointment”).
4. Add it to the flow and configure the **customizable fields**.
5. Connect its output paths:
   - `Success` → Confirmation or End Call
   - `Fail` → Escalate to Support
   - `Not Interested` → End Call

That’s it — the same reusable logic now powers multiple workflows.

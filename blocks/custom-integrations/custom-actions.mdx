## What Are Custom Actions?

Custom Actions allow you to package a series of connected blocks into a single reusable block.\
Once created, you can reuse this actions across multiple call flows, share it with your organization, or even publish it to the marketplace.

Think of a Custom Action as a mini reusable workflow inside your larger flow. It behaves like a single block but contains its own inner logic, inputs, and outputs.

## Why Custom Actions Matter

- **Reusability:** Build a workflow once (e.g., appointment scheduling, lead collection, verification) and reuse it across multiple flows.
- **Consistency:** Ensure teams follow the same steps and structure for repeated processes.
- **Scalability:** Share standard actions (like “Verify Customer Identity”) across teams and departments.
- **Mantainability:** Update logic in one place, changes automatically propagate to all flows using that action.

## Building a Custom Action (Appointment Example)

Let’s build a Make Appointment Custom Action that collects a preferred time, checks availability, and books an appointment.

![How To Create A Custom Action Gi](/assets/how-to-create-a-custom-action.gif)

### Start from Your Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an existing call flow (e.g., your appointment scheduling flow).">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the ＋ button under any existing block.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Build a Custom Action. A purple editor window opens, this is your custom action workspace.">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add Blocks to Your Custom Action

Inside the purple area (your Custom Action workspace), you can start building just like you would in a regular flow.

Click the **＋ button** below the **Start node** to open the block selector, then choose any block you want to add, for example, Talk, Collect, API Request, or Send Email.

  alt="Add Blocks To A Custom Action Pn"
  style={{ width:"84%" }}
/>

Alternatively, you can drag blocks into the purple area from an existing flow.

<Tip>
  When you drag a block into a Custom Action, it becomes part of that action’s internal logic. This means it is disconnected from any nodes outside the group.

  Only the designated output nodes (e.g., Success, Error) can connect outside the Custom Action to the rest of your main flow.
</Tip>

Inside the purple area, you can drag and connect blocks just like a normal workflow.

### Configuring an  Custom Action - Appointment Example

Let’s walk through how to configure a Custom Action that handles appointment scheduling for a legal office.

## **Check Availability (Google Calendar)**

After collecting details:

Click ＋ and select Google Calendar.

Choose the Check Availability action.

[Learn how you can connect phonely with your google calendar here](/blocks/live-call-integrations/google-calendar)

<Expandable title="Configuration Details">
  - Calendar ID – choose the calendar to check.
  - Start time & search window – when to begin scanning.
  - Slot duration – 15m, 30m, 1h, etc.
  - Business hours – restrict available times
  - Number of slots to return – how many options to offer the caller.
</Expandable>

<img
  src="/assets/check-availability-custom-action.png"
  alt="Check Availability Custom Action Pn"
  title="Check Availability Custom Action Pn"
  style={{ width:"90%" }}
/>

Once configured, add a Talk or Ask block to present the available slots and allow the caller to choose one.

Example prompt:

> “I found availability at 10 AM or 2 PM. Which would you prefer?”

Capture their selection using another Collect block (e.g., `selected_slot`).

## Create Appointment (Google Calendar)

Now add the second Google Calendar block:

1. Click **＋** and select **Google Calendar**.
1. Chose the Create Appointment.

<Expandable title="Fields to configure">
  Calendar ID

  Start Time / End Time

  Attendee Email → use the variable from Collect (e.g., caller_email)

  Title (e.g., “Consultation with caller_name”)

  Description (optional)
</Expandable>

If successful, Google Calendar automatically sends the guest invitation.

### Connect Output Paths

Output nodes define how your **Custom Action** communicates results back to the main flow.\
They act as exit points - determining what happens once your action finishes, whether it succeeds, fails, or the caller ends the process.

![Managing Output Nodes Gi](/assets/managing-output-nodes.gif)

**Understanding Output Paths**

Each output path represents a possible outcome of your action. For example:

- **Success:** The action completed successfully. i.e The appointment was booked and confirmed.
- **Fail:** Something went wrong during the process. i.e The booking API request failed or returned an error.
- **Not Interested:** The caller declined to proceed. i.e The client decided not to book or continue with the call.

These output paths let you control what the AI should do next, ensuring that every scenario is handled gracefully.

**Adding Output Nodes**

1. Click any empty area inside the purple Custom Action box (the group area).
2. The **Global Settings** panel will slide in from the right side.
3. Under **Output Paths**, you’ll see existing nodes (e.g., _Success_, _Fail_, _Not Interested_).
4. To create a new one, click **➕ Add Output Path**, then enter a name - for example, _Escalate_ or _Reschedule_.
5. Click **Done** to save your changes.

Once saved, each output path will appear as a small circle at the bottom of the purple Custom Action box, ready to connect to the next step in your flow.

### Connect to End Call and Post-Call Actions

Once your appointment logic is complete and all outcome paths are defined, you need to connect your Custom Action to the End Call block and any post-call actions that should run after the conversation finishes.

**Add the End Call Block**

At the bottom of your flow, click the **＋ button** and select **End Call**.\
This block finalizes the interaction once all other actions have run.

**Link Each Output Path to Its Next Step**

Make sure every outcome path from your Custom Action connects to the appropriate block:

| **Output Path**    | **Typical Connection**                  | **Example Action**                                                        |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Success**        | End Call\> Send SMS or Send Email       | “Your consultation is confirmed for Thursday at 2 PM.”                    |
| **Error**          | \> Escalate to Support or Transfer Call | Route the caller to a live receptionist if booking fails.                 |
| **Not Interested** | \> End Call                             | Politely close the call: “Alright, no problem — thank you for your time.” |

These connections ensure that each scenario is gracefully handled without leaving the caller in an unfinished state.

**Add Optional Post-Call Actions**

If you want to follow up or log the appointment automatically, add post-call blocks:

- **Send Email:** Send an internal summary to your legal assistant or client.
- **Send SMS:** Send a text reminder or confirmation link.
- **API Request:** Log the appointment into your CRM or case-management system.
- **Code Block:** Run custom logic - for example, update case status or trigger automation in another tool.

You can also chain this Custom Action to other Custom Actions, creating seamless workflows across multiple integrations.

![Post Call Options For Custom Actions Gi](/assets/post-call-options-for-custom-actions.gif)

Once all nodes are connected and fields are configured, your Custom Action for appointment booking is ready.

### Publishing Your Custom Action

Once your Custom Action is complete and tested, the next step is to **publish** or **save it as a draft**, either for private testing, internal team use, or public sharing. Publishing determines who can access, reuse, and configure the action in other call flows.

![Saving And Publishing A Custom Action Gi](/assets/saving-and-publishing-a-custom-action.gif)

**Accessing the Publish Options**

To begin publishing:

1. Click the **⋯ (three vertical dots)** at the **top-right corner** of the purple Custom Action area.
2. From the dropdown menu, select one of the following options:

| **Option**                  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Save as Draft**           | Keeps the Custom Action private to your current flow. Ideal for ongoing testing or early prototypes.                                            |
| **Publish to Organization** | Shares the Custom Action with your team members. Everyone in your organization can add it to their own call flows and update to newer versions. |
| **Publish to Marketplace**  | Submits the action for public review and distribution, making it available to all users on Phonely.                                             |

### Configure Customizable Fields

After selecting a publish option, Phonely will prompt you to configure fields.\
This step defines which variables other users can edit when they use your Custom Action in their own flows.

1. The **Configure Fields** window opens automatically. Here you’ll see all **available nodes**, such as headers and query parameters, listed on the left panel.
2. Check the boxes next to the parameters that you want users to customize for example:
3. On the right side, Phonely shows editable text fields labeled:\
   “User will enter value here.” This indicates that the selected parameter will be visible and configurable by others.
4. Click **Next** to continue once you’ve chosen all relevant fields.

### Finalize the Integration details and Submit

After configuring fields, you’ll move to the **Finalize Custom Action** window.    \
This is where you define how your integration will appear to others.

1. **Integration Name:** Choose an existing integration or create a new one.
2. **Description:** Provide a clear summary of what your Custom Action does.
3. **Icon:** Select an icon to represent your Custom Action.
4. **Action Name:** Enter a short, clear title for the action.
5. Click **Submit** to finalize and publish.

  style={{ width:"97%" }}
/>

### Your Custom Action is now ready to use

After submission, you’ll receive a confirmation message indicating that your Custom Action has been successfully created or updated.

Depending on your chosen option:

- **Draft:** Appears only within your current project.
- **Organization:** Appears in your team’s shared action library.
- **Marketplace:** Submitted for review by Phonely’s moderation team before public listing.

You can always return to the **⋯** menu to Update the action,Edit metadata (name, description) or re-publish.

You and your team can now find the published action under the \*\*Custom Actions \*\*sections under your chosen integration name ready to drag, configure, and connect into their own call flows.

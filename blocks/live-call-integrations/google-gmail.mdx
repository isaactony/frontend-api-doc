Phonely’s Gmail integration allows your automated call flows to send emails directly from your Gmail account, perfect for follow-ups, confirmations, or notifications triggered during live calls.

This guide walks you through every step of connecting your Gmail account and testing the integration successfully.

## Add the Gmail Action to Your Flow

1. In your flow editor, locate the point where you want to send an email.
2. Click the **➕ (plus)** icon under the block (for example, under a _Collect_ block).
3. A menu appears with two sections:
   - Flow blocks (like Talk, Collect, Ask Exactly)
   - Live Call Actions
4. From **Live Call Actions**, select **Gmail**.

You’ll now see a new **Gmail** block added to your flow.

## Choose the Gmail Action

When the Gmail setup panel opens:

1. In the **Action** dropdown, choose **Send Email**.\
   This is the default and only Gmail action currently supported, it lets your flow compose and send emails through your Gmail account.
2. Click **Continue** to move to the **Connection** setup.

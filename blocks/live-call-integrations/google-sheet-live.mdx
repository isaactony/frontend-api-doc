---

You can connect your Phonely workflows to Google Sheets to instantly retrieve or update live data during calls. This is useful for real-time order tracking, customer data lookups, or referencing information stored in spreadsheets, without any manual work.

With this integration, you can:

- Look up order information in real time, such as status, shipping date, or product details.
- Automate responses to common order inquiries without human intervention.
- Leverage Google Sheets to store and organize data for seamless integration with Phonely.

## Example Use Case

Let’s say a customer calls to check their **order status**. Instead of transferring them to a support agent, Phonely can automatically:

1. Ask for their order number.
2. Search Google Sheets for that order.
3. Retrieve and speak the live order status and shipping date back to the customer.

## Start a New Flow

1. From the **Agent Design** menu, click **Create Flow**.
2. Add a **Start Flow** block to define when the flow should trigger.
   - Example trigger: “When a customer asks about their order.”
3. Add a **Collect** or **Ask Exactly** block to capture the **order number** or any variable you’ll use for lookup.

## Add the Google Sheets Action

1. Click the **(+)** icon below your block to add a new connection.
2. Under **Live Call Actions**, select **Google Sheets**.
3. Choose the action **Search a Row** from the dropdown.
   - This action allows Phonely to search your sheet for a value (e.g., an order number) and return matching data.
4. Click **Connect to Google Sheets** to begin linking your account.

## Link Your Google Account

1. A browser window will appear asking you to **choose a Google account**.
2. Log in and **select all permissions** to allow Phonely access your Sheets**.**

<Danger>
  Your login credentials are never stored by Phonely.
</Danger>

3. After authorization, the **Connect to Continue** button will activate.
4. Click it to proceed.

## Configure the Search

1. **Select Spreadsheet and Tab** - Choose the Google Sheet you want to connect under **Spreadsheet**, then select the specific **Tab** (worksheet) that contains your data.
2. **Sync Columns** - Click **Sync Column Names** to automatically fetch all column headers from your sheet for use in conditions or variable mapping.  
3. **Include All Data (Optional)** - You can enable Include all data in agent context if you want Phonely to load all search results into the AI’s context for later use in conversation.
4. **Define Search Conditions** - Under **Conditions**, specify how Phonely should search for the data:
   - Click **Add Condition**
   - Select a field (e.g., `order_number`)
   - Choose a comparison type (e.g., _is equal to_)
   - Enter the matching variable or value (e.g., the caller’s provided order number)\
     If multiple rows match, Phonely will return the first row by default.

5. **Advanced Settings (Optional)** — Enable **Interim Message** to let the caller know the agent is processing their request (e.g., “Please hold while I look that up”).   

**Next steps**

- **Continue** — Once everything is configured, click **Continue** to move to the **Test** step.
- **Test the Connection** — Click **Test** to confirm that Phonely can successfully find a row in your selected sheet.

<Tip>
  If you set any conditions earlier, testing will search for a row in your spreadsheet that matches those conditions. You can skip this test if you’re confident in your setup.
</Tip>

- If successful, you’ll see a “**Match found**” message showing the returned data.
- You can also choose **Skip Test** if you’re confident in your setup.

## Test and Publish

1. Click **Test Your Agent** to simulate a call and verify that the correct data is fetched.
2. If everything works, click **Publish** to make the workflow live.
3. Any time a customer calls about their order, Phonely will automatically look up the latest data in Google Sheets.

## Handle Success and Error Paths

Once the search action runs, Phonely creates two possible branches:

- **Success** — the row was found in Google Sheets.
- **Error** — no match was found or the sheet could not be accessed.

Under each branch, you can add blocks to:

- Speak or message the result.
- Apologize or ask for a new input if no match is found.

  title="Success And Error Google Sheets Pn"
  style={{ width:"91%" }}
/>

**Example:**

- On Success → **Say Exactly**:\
  “Your order status is `order_status` and your expected delivery date is `ship_date`.”
- On Error → **Say Exactly**:\
  “I couldn’t find that order number. Could you repeat it once more?”

  **Pro Tips**

  1. **Automate Updates:** Use tools like Zapier to automatically update your Google Sheets with new order data from your CRM or shipping provider.
  2. **Include Multiple Variables:** Add as much relevant data as possible (e.g., product details, tracking numbers) for a more comprehensive response.
  3. **Optimize Workflow Logic:** Use filters to ensure accurate matches between customer input and your data.

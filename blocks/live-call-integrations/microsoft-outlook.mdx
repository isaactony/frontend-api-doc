Phonely’s Microsoft Outlook integration allows your AI agent to send automated emails directly from your Outlook account — either during a live call or after a call ends.\
This integration helps streamline communication by enabling your agent to send follow-ups, notifications, or real-time alerts without manual effort.\
This guide walks you through setting up the Outlook connection, authorizing your account, configuring your email details, and testing the workflow.

## **1. Access the Integration Panel**

1. From your Phonely dashboard, click **Agent Design** on the left sidebar.
2. Open an existing **workflow** or click **Create New Flow** to start a new one.
3. Click the **plus (+)** icon on the right side of your selected block.
4. In the menu that appears, scroll down to Post Call Actions (or Live Call Actions) and select Microsoft Outlook.

<Tip>
  Live Call Actions execute while the conversation is ongoing, while Post Call Actions trigger after the call has ended.
</Tip>

## **2. Choose an Action**

Once the **Microsoft Outlook** integration window opens, you’ll be guided through three stages: **Setup**, **Configure**, and **Test**.

1. Under the **Setup** tab, open the **Action** dropdown menu.
2. Choose **Send Email** — this action allows your Phonely agent to compose and send an email through your connected Outlook account.
3. Click **Add Connection** to begin linking your Microsoft Outlook account.

<Tip>
   You only need to connect your Outlook account once. After authorization, it will be available for use in all your workflows.
</Tip>

## **3. Link Your Microsoft Outlook Account**

When you click **Add Connection**, A popup window appears asking you to **Connect**.

Once you click Connect, Phonely prompts you to authorize access to your Outlook account.

### **If You Are Already Signed In**

- Phonely detects your existing Microsoft login automatically.

### **If You Are Not Signed In**

1. Select your account or click **Use another account** to sign in.
2. Review the permissions requested by _phonely-integrations_:
   - **Send mail as you** – Allows Phonely to send emails from your account.
   - **Read and write access to your mail** – Lets Phonely create, update, and manage emails in your mailbox.
   - **Maintain access to data you have given Phonely access to** – Keeps the integration active even when you’re offline.
   - **Read your profile** – Enables Phonely to identify your account and link it correctly.
3. Click **Accept** to grant permissions.

<Tip>
  Phonely uses secure OAuth authentication through Microsoft — your login credentials are never stored or shared.
</Tip>

Once you accept, the popup will close automatically, and Phonely will refresh to show your connected Outlook account.

## 4. Confirm the Connection

When authorization is successful:

- The **Connection** dropdown will display your Outlook account.
- A green status indicator confirms the link is active.
- The **Continue** button becomes active — click it to move to the next step.

<Tip>
  If you want to add multiple accounts, click Add Connection and repeat the steps above to add another Outlook account.
</Tip>

## 5. Configure Email Settings

In the **Configure** step, define the details of the email that will be sent by your agent.

1. **Recipient Email**
   - Enter the target email address or use dynamic variables from the call .
   - You can add multiple recipients.
   - During live calls, this could be a support address or teammate; after calls, it might be a customer follow-up address.
2. **Subject Line**
   - Write a clear subject.
   - Include call-related variables like `caller_name`, `call_id`, or `call_summary` for personalized messages.
3. **Message Body**
   - Draft the content of the email.
   - Use this space to send thank-you messages, call outcomes, or data collected during the conversation.
   - HTML formatting is supported for stylized layouts or signatures.
4. **Attachments (Optional)**
   - Attach call summaries, transcripts, or documents generated during the workflow.
   - Common use case: attach a transcript when sending internal summaries post-call.

3. Check your Outlook inbox for a confirmation email.

<Tip>
  If the email appears successfully, your integration is fully functional. If not, double-check your permissions or reauthorize the connection.

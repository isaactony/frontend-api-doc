Phonely’s Microsoft Outlook integration allows your AI agent to send automated emails directly from your Outlook account — either during a live call or after a call ends.\
This integration helps streamline communication by enabling your agent to send follow-ups, notifications, or real-time alerts without manual effort.\
This guide walks you through setting up the Outlook connection, authorizing your account, configuring your email details, and testing the workflow.

## **1. Access the Integration Panel**

1. From your Phonely dashboard, click **Agent Design** on the left sidebar.
2. Open an existing **workflow** or click **Create New Flow** to start a new one.
3. Click the **plus (+)** icon on the right side of your selected block.
4. In the menu that appears, scroll down to Post Call Actions (or Live Call Actions) and select Microsoft Outlook.

<Tip>
  Live Call Actions execute while the conversation is ongoing, while Post Call Actions trigger after the call has ended.
</Tip>

## **2. Choose an Action**

Once the **Microsoft Outlook** integration window opens, you’ll be guided through three stages: **Setup**, **Configure**, and **Test**.

1. Under the **Setup** tab, open the **Action** dropdown menu.
2. Choose **Send Email** — this action allows your Phonely agent to compose and send an email through your connected Outlook account.
3. Click **Add Connection** to begin linking your Microsoft Outlook account.

<Tip>
  You only need to connect your Outlook account once. After authorization, it will be available for use in all your workflows.
</Tip>

## **3. Link Your Microsoft Outlook Account**

When you click **Add Connection**, A popup window appears asking you to **Connect**.

Once you click Connect, Phonely prompts you to authorize access to your Outlook account.

### **If You Are Already Signed In**

- Phonely detects your existing Microsoft login automatically.

### **If You Are Not Signed In**

1. Select your account or click \*\*Add Account \*\*to sign in.
2. Review the permissions requested by _phonely-integrations_:
   - Send mail as you – Allows Phonely to send emails from your account.
   - Read and write access to your mail – Lets Phonely create, update, and manage emails in your mailbox.
   - Maintain access to data you have given Phonely access to – Keeps the integration active even when you’re offline.
   - Read your profile – Enables Phonely to identify your account and link it correctly.
3. Click **Accept** to grant permissions.

<Tip>
  Phonely uses secure OAuth authentication through Microsoft — your login credentials are never stored or shared.
</Tip>

Once you accept, the popup will close automatically, and Phonely will refresh to show your connected Outlook account.

## 4. Confirm the Connection

When authorization is successful:

- The **Connection** dropdown will display your Outlook account.
- A green status indicator confirms the link is active.
- The **Continue** button becomes active — click it to move to the next step.

<Tip>
  If you want to add multiple accounts, click Add Connection and repeat the steps above to add another Outlook account.
</Tip>

## 5. Configure Email Settings

In the **Configure** step, define exactly how your agent should send the email during or after a call. This includes setting recipients, subject, body content, and fine-tuning behavior through **Advanced Settings**.

### **Recipient (To)**

Enter one or more email addresses that should receive the message.

- Use Add Recipient to include multiple recipients.
- You can use dynamic variables (e.g., `caller_email`) to personalize who receives the message based on the call data.
- For live calls, this might be a teammate or support inbox; for post-call workflows, it’s often the customer or lead.

### **Subject**

Write a clear, relevant subject line for your email.

### **Body**

Compose the message that will be sent to recipients.

- Use this section to share updates, summarize call details, or thank the customer for their time.
- You can insert dynamic variables captured during the call.
- The message can be written in Plain Text or HTML format, depending on your needs.

<Tip>
  HTML mode allows for stylized layouts, signatures, links, or branded templates, while Plain Text is best for simple, system-generated messages.
</Tip>

## **Advanced Settings**

Click **Advanced Settings** to access additional configuration options that define how your email behaves.

### **Body Type**

Select how your email content should be formatted:

- **HTML** – Use this for formatted or branded emails.
- **Plain Text** – Use this for simpler, lightweight communication.

### **Cc (Carbon Copy)**

Add additional recipients who should receive a visible copy of the email.

- This is ideal for notifying supervisors or team members of customer interactions.

### **Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy)**

Add recipients who will receive a hidden copy of the email.

### **Reply To**

Specify an email address for responses if you don’t want replies sent to the sender’s account.

### **Interim Message**

Enable this option to send a short, temporary message to the caller while the email is being processed during a live call.

- Check **Interim Message** to activate it.
- In the **Interim Message Prompt**, write or generate a friendly phrase such as:\
  _“Please hold on while I send that for you.”_

<Tip>
  This setting improves caller experience by confirming that the system is working on their request.
</Tip>

### **Post Interim Message Delay (Optional)**

If selected, Phonely will wait a few seconds before sending the interim message — useful for smoothing timing between live agent responses.

### **Call Outcome Tagging**

Add one or more tags to categorize the result of the action or call.

- Example: _“follow-up,” “lead,” “escalated”_
- These tags make it easier to filter and track calls in your reports or analytics dashboards.

### **Finishing Up**

Once all required fields (To, Subject, and Body) are filled in, the Continue button becomes active.\
Click Continue to move on to the Test step, where you can send a test email and verify that your configuration works as intended.

## 6. Test the Integration

Before publishing, it’s important to confirm your Outlook connection is working.

1. Go to the **Test** tab in the setup panel.
2. Click **Send Test Email**.
3. Check your Outlook inbox for a confirmation email.

<Tip>
  If the email appears successfully, your integration is fully functional. If not, double-check your permissions or reauthorize the connection.

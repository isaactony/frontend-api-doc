The Slack integration allows your Phonely agent to send messages directly to your Slack workspace — automatically sharing call updates, summaries, or notifications in real time.\
This guide walks you through the full process — from connecting your Slack workspace to Phonely, configuring channels, and testing your setup.

## 1. Access the Integration Panel

1. From your **Phonely Dashboard**, open the **Agent Design** section.
2. Select an existing **workflow** or click **Create New Flow**.
3. Click the **plus (+)** icon and choose **Slack** from the integration options.

## 2. Choose an Action

In the **Setup** tab of the Slack integration panel:

1. Open the **Action** dropdown menu.
2. Select **Send Channel Message** — this tells Phonely to post a message to a chosen Slack channel.
3. Click **Connect to Slack** to start linking your workspace.

## 3. Authorize the Connection

When you click **Connect to Slack**, you’ll be redirected to Slack’s authorization page to grant Phonely access.

### **Choose the Right Workspace**

- Select the workspace where you want Phonely to send messages.
- If your current workspace has reached the app limit (as shown in the screenshot), you’ll see a message like:

  <Tip>
    Workspaces on free plans can only install 10 apps. You can add Phonely if you upgrade your workspace or remove one of your existing apps.
  </Tip>
- If this appears:
  - Either **remove one app** from your workspace, or
  - **Switch to another workspace** from the dropdown list.

<Tip>
  If you have multiple Slack workspaces, make sure you choose the one where your team manages calls or notifications.
</Tip>

### **Review Permissions**

Once you select a workspace, you’ll see a screen to **install the Phonely app**.\
Phonely will request the following permissions:

- Access to content and info about you
- Access to messages and channels where it posts
- Basic info about your workspace

Click **Install Phonely** to approve and complete the connection.\
You’ll automatically be redirected back to Phonely once authorization succeeds.

## 4. Confirm the Connection

When connected successfully:

- The **Connection** field in the setup window will now show your Slack workspace.
- A green checkmark confirms that Phonely is linked to Slack.
- The **Continue** button activates, allowing you to proceed to configuration.

## **5. Configure Slack Message Settings**

Once connected, move to the **Configure** tab.

### **Select a Channel**

- Use the **Channel** dropdown to choose where Phonely will post messages.
- You can search for any public or private channel your connected Slack account has access to.
- If your desired channel doesn’t appear, create it in Slack first and then refresh your Phonely integration window.

### **Write the Message**

In the message field:

- Enter the text you want Phonely to post to your Slack channel.
- Use **variables** (e.g., `CallerName`, `Summary`, `AgentName`) to include dynamic call data.
- Example message:

  ```
  New call handled by AgentName  
  Caller: CallerName  
  Summary: Summary  
  Outcome: CallOutcome
  ```

## **6. Test the Integration**

Once your configuration is complete, open the **Test** tab.

Click **Test** to send the sample message to the selected Slack channel.

<Tip>
  If the message appears in Slack, your connection and configuration are successful.

  If you don’t see the message, verify that you’ve authorized the correct workspace and selected an accessible channel.

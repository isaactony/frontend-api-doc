## Connect Your Google Account

1. Click **“Connect to Google Calendar.”**
   - A pop-up will appear prompting you to link your Google account.
2. Select the Google account you want to connect.
   - Choose from the list of accounts or click **“Use another account”** if not listed.
3. Review the permissions requested and click **“Continue.”**
   - This authorizes Phonely to securely access your calendar.
4. Once authenticated, Phonely will display **“Reconnected”** or **“Connected”** under the connection field.

## Verify and Continue

1. Once your Google Calendar is connected, the **Setup** step will be marked complete with a checkmark.
2. Click **“Continue”** to proceed to the **Configure** stage.
3. Depending on your selected action:
   - For **Check Availability**, specify the time range and conditions for checking free/busy slots.
   - For **Create Appointment**, define event details like title, time, and attendees.

## Configure the Google Calendar

After connecting your Google Calendar, the Configure step changes depending on the Action you selected in the Setup stage.

### Configuration options for "Check Availability" Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calendar ID">
    Open the **Calendar ID** dropdown and pick the calendar you authorized (personal calendar, team calendar, or a resources calendar).

    If you recently created or shared a calendar, hit the **refresh** icon to re-load the list.

    <Tip>
      Use a dedicated “Bookings” calendar so customer appointments don’t mix with your personal events
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Time">
    Set when the search should begin (ISO timestamp is accepted, but you can click the **clock** icon to use _now_).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Duration">
    Enter the meeting length using natural units like `15m`, `30m`, `1h`.

    This duration defines the size of each candidate slot the agent will look for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search Period">
    - How far into the future to scan for open times, in days.
    - Longer windows increase options but also time to evaluate, keep it reasonable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Available Time Slots (count)">
    - Set how many distinct slots to retrieve and present.
    - This doesn’t change your calendar- only how many options the caller hears before choosing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Available Times (per-day windows)">
    Define the business hours the agent should consider **within** the search period. Each weekday has:

    - A **toggle** to enable/disable that day entirely.
    - A **from \> to** time window (e.g., `9:00 am → 5:00 pm`).
    - **\+** to add another window for split shifts (e.g., `9–12` and `2–5`).
    - **✕** to remove a window.
    - **Notes:**
      - These hours gate the search; if your calendar is open at 7pm but the day is disabled or outside the window, it won’t be offered.
      - Timezone respects your agent/project settings, ensure your business hours align with the intended timezone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Interim Message">
    When enabled, the agent narrates what it’s doing (“One moment while I check availability…”), which reduces dead air.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post Interim Message Delay">
    Adds a short pause after the interim message to avoid talking over the API response on slower networks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interim Message Prompt">
    - **Fixed** – always use the text you provide verbatim.
    - **Promptable** – let the LLM vary the phrasing while keeping your intent (good for more natural conversations).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Outcome Tagging">
    - Add keywords (e.g., `booking_created`, `no_availability`, `calendar_error`) to tag call analytics when this block completes.
    - These tags help reporting and downstream automation.

    When you’ve filled the required fields, the **Continue** button activates. Click it to advance
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Configuration options for “Create Appointment” Action**

Choose this action when the Phonely agent should **book an event directly** in Google Calendar.\
This setup shares some base fields (like Calendar ID, Start Time, and Advanced Settings) but also includes unique fields specific to appointment creation.

![Google Calendar Appointments Phonely Gi](/assets/google-calendar-appointments-phonely.gif)

<Steps>
  <Step title="End Time">
    Defines when the scheduled event ends. Must be later than the start time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email">
    Required field where you enter the attendee’s email.

    The system automatically sends a Google Calendar invitation to this address once the booking is created. You can use dynamic variables (e.g., caller email) captured earlier in the flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Appointment Name">
    The event title as it appears in your calendar and the attendee’s invite.

    <Tip>
      Example: _Consultation with Jane Doe_ or _Onboarding Call – Product Demo_.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Appointment Description">
    A short summary of what the appointment is about.

    Appears inside the calendar event’s description field.

    <Tip>
      Example: _Discuss project requirements and timeline for Q4 deliverables._
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Settings">
    Here you can add an optional Interim Message, Post Message Delay, and Call Outcome Tagging.

    <Tip>
      Example interim message: _“Hold on while I book that time for you.”_
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test the configuration

Once configuration is complete, move to the **Test** tab to confirm that your Google Calendar connection and parameters work correctly.\
The behavior of the test depends on which **Action** you chose earlier, **Check Availability** or **Create Appointment**.

### **When Action = Check Availability**

The **Test** tab runs a dry-run against your calendar with the exact parameters you configured. It checks your defined working hours, slot duration, and search period, then lists which time slots are open.

#### What You’ll See

**1. Test Configuration Summary **

Displays the configuration details that were used for the test.

- **Selected Calendar** – which Google Calendar is being queried
- **Duration** – length of each slot (e.g., 15m or 30m)

**2. Available Slots Found Panel:**\
Shows a table of available slots. Each row includes Start Time \> End Time pairs.

These are real, conflict-free ranges within your defined working hours.

#### What You’ll See

**1. Test Configuration Summary:**\
Lists the appointment details that will be used for the event creation, including: **Calendar**, **Title**, **Attendee Email**, and **Start Time / End Time** – the scheduled duration of the appointment

<Tip>

The **Redial block** in Phonely allows you to automatically retry a call after a specified duration or move it to another campaign for follow-up. This helps improve your connection rate by ensuring that missed or unanswered calls are reattempted intelligently, based on your workflow setup.

### Where to Find It

The Redial block is located under Post Call Actions in the Flow Editor.\
It is typically connected after an End Call block to define what happens if the call wasn’t answered, went to voicemail, or ended unsuccessfully.

### Configuring the Redial Block

When you add a **Redial** block to your flow, a configuration panel opens on the right. Here, you can set how and when the system should retry the call.

Let’s go through each setting:

#### 1. **Action**

The **Action** dropdown defines what should happen after the redial trigger:

- **Retry After** – Attempts to call the same number again after a specific delay.
- **Move to Campaign** – Transfers the contact to a different campaign (useful for follow-ups or escalation flows).

#### 2. **Delay Duration**

This field specifies how long the system should wait before redialing.

You can set the delay in:

- **Minutes**
- **Hours**
- **Days**

For example:

- `Retry After 10 Minutes` \> The system will retry the call after 10 minutes.
- `Retry After 2 Hours` \> Useful for scheduling later follow-ups within the day.

#### 3. **Override Voicemail Message (Optional)**

When enabled, this option allows you to customize the voicemail message that the AI leaves during a redial attempt.

- Check **Override Voicemail Message**
- Enter a custom message in the **Voicemail Message** field\
  Example:\
  _“Hi, we’re calling to follow up on your recent inquiry. Please call us back at your convenience.”_

This helps you control how your brand communicates when an agent or AI redials a customer.

### Adding Multiple Redial Attempts

You can configure **multiple retry attempts** for each call:

1. Click **Add Redial Attempt** at the bottom of the panel.
2. For each attempt:
   - Define a unique delay (e.g., 1st retry after 30 minutes, 2nd retry after 2 hours).
   - Optionally, add different voicemail messages per attempt.

Example setup:

<Tip>
  You can configure more than one redial attempt to maximize your chances of reaching the customer. For example:

  - **First Attempt:** Set the action to **Retry After**, then enter a delay of **30 minutes**.\
    This means Phonely will automatically try to call the same number again half an hour after the first call ends.\
    You might also add a short voicemail message such as:\
    _“We tried reaching you earlier today regarding your inquiry. Please call us back when convenient.”_
  - **Second Attempt:** Add another redial attempt and again choose **Retry After**, this time with a delay of **2 hours**.\
    This ensures a follow-up attempt happens later in the day, giving the customer more time to respond.\
    You could use a different voicemail, for example:\
    _“Following up on our earlier call — we just wanted to reconnect and assist you further.”_
</Tip>

This tiered approach increases your chances of reaching the customer while avoiding spammy behavior.

### Typical Use Case

A common use case for the Redial block is when a call ends unsuccessfully due to:

- Busy lines
- Missed calls
- Voicemail detection

By linking the Redial block to your End Call block:

1. Phonely ends the initial call attempt.
2. Waits for the configured delay duration.
3. Automatically redials or moves the contact to the next workflow.

### Best Practices

- **Start small:** Begin with one retry attempt before adding multiple to avoid overwhelming customers.
- **Use meaningful delays:** A gap of at least 30 minutes between retries prevents call fatigue.
- **Customize voicemails:** Personalize each voicemail for professionalism and context.

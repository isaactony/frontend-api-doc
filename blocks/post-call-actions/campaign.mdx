The **Campaign block** allows you to automatically add callers to a specific outbound campaign once a call or flow interaction ends.\
This is useful when you want to follow up with the caller later, transfer them to a sales or reminder campaign, or move them into a different workflow for future communication.

### Overview

Campaigns are a powerful way to **organize and automate outbound calls**.\
When a call reaches this block, Phonely automatically places the contact into the selected campaign’s outbound queue.\
From there, the system can redial them according to your campaign schedule, or assign them to agents for follow-up.

### How the Campaign Block Works

When you add a **Campaign** block into your flow, you’re essentially telling Phonely:

> “Once this call reaches this point, add the contact to Campaign X for later follow-up.”

This ensures that every caller who meets certain conditions (like missed calls, sales interest, or incomplete forms) is not lost instead, they’re automatically scheduled for another touchpoint.

### Configuring the Campaign Block

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Flow Editor">
    Add a **Campaign** block from the side menu.

    Connect it to the previous block (such as _End Call_ or _Conditional_).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Target Campaign">
    In the **Campaign** dropdown, choose from your list of existing campaigns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign the Caller">
    Once a campaign is selected, any caller who reaches this block will automatically be added to that campaign’s outbound queue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Done** to confirm your configuration. Validate your flow before publishing to ensure there are no unresolved issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Use Cases

Here are some real-world scenarios where the Campaign block is especially helpful:

#### 1. Missed Call Follow-Ups

If a customer misses a call or the line is busy, use the **Campaign block** to automatically add them to a _Follow-Up Campaign_. This ensures they’re called back later without manual tracking.

#### 2. Appointment Reminders

For healthcare, salons, or service-based businesses, direct customers who confirm or reschedule their appointments into an _Appointment Reminder Campaign_.\
This campaign can automatically send reminders or follow-up calls before the appointment date.

#### 3. Sales or Lead Nurturing

After an initial inquiry, route callers into a _Sales Follow-Up Campaign_ to ensure your team re-engages with them systematically, improving conversion rates.

#### 4. Re-engagement Campaigns

If a customer’s call outcome is “No Response,” send them to a _Reactivation Campaign_ for another outreach attempt later.

The Campaign block is your automation bridge between inbound and outbound communication.\
It ensures that every caller — whether missed, interested, or needing follow-up — is queued into the right workflow without manual effort.

By connecting it thoughtfully within your flow, you can build a fully automated engagement cycle that keeps your outreach consistent and efficient.

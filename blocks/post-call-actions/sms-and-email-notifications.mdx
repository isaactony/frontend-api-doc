Phonely’s Email & SMS Notification feature allows your AI agent to automatically send call summaries and notifications to your team via email or text message.\
These notifications can be triggered after a call ends, keeping your team informed of customer interactions, lead updates, or any call outcomes, even when they’re away from their dashboard.

This guide explains how to set up these notifications step-by-step.

2. Open an existing **workflow** or create a **new flow**.

## Configure Notification Recipients

Once the Email & SMS Notification window opens, you’ll see two main sections:\
Email Recipients and Phone Numbers.

Both sections let you define who should receive the call summary and follow-up information.

3. Each recipient will receive an automatic email containing:
   - Caller details.
   - Call summary or transcript (if available).
   - Assigned agent name.
   - Key notes or outcomes from the call.

### Phone Numbers

Under **Phone Numbers**, you can configure **SMS alerts** to notify team members right after a call concludes.

1. Enter one or more **phone numbers**.
2. Click **Add Phone Number** to add more recipients.
3. Each number will receive a text message summarizing conversations.

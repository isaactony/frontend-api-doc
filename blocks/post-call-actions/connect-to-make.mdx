This guide explains how to connect your **Phonely** account to **Make (formerly Integromat)** to automatically send call data and trigger workflows. You’ll create a webhook in Make, configure a scenario to receive data from Phonely, and set up a return output scenario for handling structured responses.

### Overview

Phonely can push call data (like caller name, phone number, transcript, and summary) to Make through a webhook URL.\
To receive and process this data correctly, Make requires:

1. A **Webhook** module to capture data from Phonely.
2. A **Scenario** that defines the data structure (inputs and outputs).
3. A **Return Output** module that allows the webhook to send structured results back to Phonely.

### Create a Webhook in Make

1. In Make, go to **Webhooks** from the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Open Scenario Builder**.
3. In the Scenario Builder, click the **\+** icon to add a module.
4. Search for **Webhooks (Built-in)**.


4. Select **Custom Webhook** under **Triggers**.
5. Click **Add**, name your webhook, and click **Save**.
6. Make will generate a unique **Webhook URL** (e.g.,\
   `https://hook.eu1.make.com/your-webhook-id`).
7. Clikc copy address to clipborad to copy the webhook url.

Click **Run once** — you should see “**Listening for data…**”.

<Tip>
  If you run the Phonely test _before_ the scenario is listening, you get and error saying that there is no scenario listening for this webhook. 
</Tip>

If Make receives it, you’ll see a successful bundle appear in that webhook module, and Phonely’s test will show success.

Without closing that page, go back to **Phonely** and follow the steps below.

### Connect the Webhook in Phonely

1. In your Phonely dashboard, open the **Flow Editor**.
2. Add a **Make** block and paste the copied **Webhook URL** into the configuration field.
3. (Optional) Enable **Send full call data to Make** if you want to send all available details such as:
   - `businessPhoneNumber`
   - `customerPhoneNumber`
   - `agentId`
   - `provider`
   - `agentName`
   - `transcript`
   - `summary`
   - `longSummary`
   - `ai_success`
4. Click **Continue** and test the webhook.

### Test and Verify

1. Trigger a test call or event from Phonely.  You should see a success message like. 

   ```
   {
     "message": "Make webhook test successful"
   }
   ```


1. In Make, open your scenario and check the execution log.
2. Confirm that:
   - The webhook received the call data.

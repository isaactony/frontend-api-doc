This guide explains how to connect your **Phonely** account to **Make (formerly Integromat)** to automatically send call data and trigger workflows. You’ll create a webhook in Make, configure a scenario to receive data from Phonely, and set up a return output scenario for handling structured responses.

### Overview

Phonely can push call data (like caller name, phone number, transcript, and summary) to Make through a webhook URL.\
To receive and process this data correctly, Make requires:

1. A **Webhook** module to capture data from Phonely.
2. A **Scenario** that defines the data structure (inputs and outputs).
3. A **Return Output** module that allows the webhook to send structured results back to Phonely.

### Create a Webhook in Make

1. In Make, go to **Webhooks** from the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Open Scenario Builder**.

2. In the Scenario Builder, click the **\+** icon to add a module.
3. Search for **Webhooks (Built-in)**.

4. Select **Custom Webhook** under **Triggers**.
5. Click **Add**, name your webhook (e.g., _Phonely Call Event_), and click **Save**.
6. Make will generate a unique **Webhook URL** (e.g.,\
   `https://hook.eu1.make.com/your-webhook-id`).
7. Copy this URL — you’ll need it in Phonely.

### Create a Return Output Scenario in Make

A return output scenario is required so that Make can send responses or processed data back to Phonely (e.g., summaries, post-call notes, or analytics).

1. In the Make **Scenarios** section, create a new scenario.
2. Add a **Webhooks** module as the trigger (Custom Webhook or Mailhook, depending on use case).
3. Connect this to a **Scenarios \> Return Output** module.
4. Open **Scenario Inputs and Outputs** from the bottom panel:
   - Under **Scenario Inputs**, define the expected fields from Phonely (e.g., `callername`, `callerphonenumber`, `summary`, `transcript`).
   - Under **Scenario Outputs**, define what data you want Make to return (e.g., processed summary, success message, timestamp).
5. Click **Save** once all input and output structures match the Phonely data fields.

### Link the Return Output Scenario to Your Webhook

1. In your **first scenario**, after the **Webhook** trigger, add another module.
2. Choose **Scenarios \> Call a Subscenario**.
3. Select the **Return Output** scenario you just created.
4. Map the input fields from Phonely to the sub-scenario inputs.
5. Save and run the scenario once to activate it.

Now, every time Phonely triggers the webhook, the call data flows into Make, is processed according to your setup, and returns structured outputs.

### Connect the Webhook in Phonely

1. In your Phonely dashboard, open the **Flow Editor**.
2. Add a **Make** block and paste the copied **Webhook URL** into the configuration field.
3. (Optional) Enable **Send full call data to Make** if you want to send all available details such as:
   - `businessPhoneNumber`
   - `customerPhoneNumber`
   - `agentId`
   - `provider`
   - `agentName`
   - `transcript`
   - `summary`
   - `longSummary`
   - `ai_success`
4. Click **Continue** and test the webhook — you should see a success message like:

   ```
   {
     "message": "Make webhook test successful"
   }
   ```

### Test and Verify

1. Trigger a test call or event from Phonely.
2. In Make, open your scenario and check the execution log.
3. Confirm that:
   - The webhook received the call data.
   - The correct scenario ran.
   - The response was sent back successfully.

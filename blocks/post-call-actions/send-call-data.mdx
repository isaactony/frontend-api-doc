The Send Call Data action allows your agents to automatically send call details, such as caller information, call duration, outcomes, and workflow data, to an external system via a webhook.\
This is particularly useful for integrating Phonely with CRMs, analytics dashboards, or automation tools like Zapier, or custom APIs.

You can configure this integration to:

- Send all call data (for analytics or logging)
- Send specific fields only (for lightweight or customized workflows)
- Format and control the payload using manual or code input modes

## Access the Send Call Data Block

1. Go to **Agent Design** in your Phonely dashboard.
2. Open or create a **workflow**.
3. Click the **plus (+)** icon after any block (commonly after **End Call**).
4. From **Post Call Actions**, select **Send Call Data**.

This action is triggered once the call ends, ensuring all relevant data is finalized before being sent.

## Configure Webhook Settings

In the **Configure** tab, you’ll define where Phonely should send your call data.

### **Webhook URL**

Enter the endpoint URL where the data will be sent.

<Tip>
  Make sure your endpoint is ready to receive POST requests with JSON data.
</Tip>

## Send Full Call Data

Toggle Send full call data to decide whether Phonely should send all available call fields or only specific ones.

### Option A: Full Call Data.

When this is checked, Phonely automatically sends the entire call payload to your webhook.

### **Option B: Custom Call Data**

If you uncheck **Send full call data**, you can manually define which fields and values to include in your payload.

You’ll then see the **Body** section with three options for customization:

- **Manual**
- **Code**

Let’s look at each in detail.

## **Manual Mode**

The **Manual** option lets you build a JSON payload by specifying each key-value pair directly.

### **How to Use**

1. Click **Add Field** to create new entries.
2. Under **Key**, define the name of your data field (e.g., `callerName`, `callSummary`).
3. Under **Value**, enter a static value or select a dynamic variable from your workflow.
4. Select the **Type** (String, Number, Boolean, etc.) for each field.

<Tip>
  Manual mode is best for simple, structured payloads sent to other systems like CRMs or notification apps.
</Tip>

## Code Mode

For advanced users, the **Code** option allows you to directly write or paste raw JSON.\
You can freely format your request body, insert variables, and structure nested objects.

## Test the Configuration

Once your webhook and payload are set up, switch to the **Test** tab to verify the connection.

1. Confirm your **Webhook URL** is correct.
2. Choose whether to send **full** or **custom** call data.
3. Click **Test**.

Phonely will send a sample payload to your webhook.\
If successful, you’ll see a **Test Result** preview with the response returned from your endpoint.

  style={{ width:"90%" }}
/>

If you see the response displayed under “Test Result,” with success status then your webhook is active and configured correctly.

If the test fails:

- Check that your webhook URL is accessible and accepts `POST` requests.
- Ensure SSL (HTTPS) is enabled for secure transmission.
- Review any authentication requirements on your server.

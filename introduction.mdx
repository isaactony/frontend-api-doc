## What is Phonely?

Phonely is the easiest way to build conversational voice agents that answer and place phone calls. You get the full conversation stack out of the box: voice, reasoning, routing, integrations, and analytics. This means you can go from idea to a production agent in minutes, not months.

With Phonely you can:

- Have natural, low-latency phone conversations
- Make and receive calls on Phonely numbers or your carrier
- Qualify, route, schedule, and escalate to humans on rules you define
- Integrate with calendars, CRMs, APIs, and internal tools
- Track performance with rich call analytics, A/B testing, and call paths

## How voice agents work

Every Phonely agent combines four building blocks:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Speech-to-Text" icon="mic-vocal" iconType="solid">
    Converts the caller’s speech into text in real time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reasoning" icon="brain-circuit" iconType="solid">
    A fine tuned conversation decides what to say and do next.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text-to-Speech" icon="volume-2" iconType="solid">
    Produces natural, human-like speech from the agent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Turn-Taking" icon="messages-square" iconType="solid">
    Interrupts, barge-in, and timing that feel human—without extra latency.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You choose the voice, define what the agent should do, and Phonely handles the live call experience end-to-end.

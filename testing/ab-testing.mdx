Phonely's A/B Testing tool helps you **experiment**, **measure, **and improve your voice AI's perfomance with real worl data . It allows you to compare different versions of you AI agent such as Voice, workflow, conversation settings to determine which one performs best in live calls. 

This guide explains how A/B testing works, how to create and run a test, and how to interpret results. 

## What is A/B Testing in Phonely ?

A/B Testing lets you run controlled experiments between two versions of your AI agent:

- The **Base Agent (Control)** — your exisiting setup.
- The **Test Agent (Variant)** — a duplicate with specific changes.

Incoming calls are automatically split between the two versions. Phonely then measures how each one perfoms based on the success criteria you define — such as call duration, outcomes, or end reasons.

This gives you clear, data-driven insights into what changes actually improve performance — instead of relying on guesswork.                        

## **Where to Access A/B Testing**

1. Go to your **Phonely Dashboard**.
2. Open your **Testing** tab.
3. Choose **A/B Testing** from the top navigation bar.

You’ll see three sections:                

- **Planned** – Tests you’ve set up but haven’t started yet.
- **In Progress** – Tests currently running on live calls.
- **Completed** – Finished tests where you can review performance results.

## **3. Creating a New A/B Test**

Click **Create a new test** in the _Planned_ section to begin. A step-by-step setup window will appear.

### **Step 1: Name and Describe Your Test**

- **Test Name:** Give your test a descriptive name that identifies what you’re testing.\
  _Example:_ “Friendly Voice vs Formal Voice – Support Line.”
- **Description:** Explain your test goal.\
  _Example:_ “Evaluate whether a friendly voice style improves appointment confirmations.”

This helps you keep track of multiple tests later

## **Choose What You’d Like to Test**

Phonely supports multiple types of tests depending on your experiment goal. You can select one of the following:

| Type               | What It Tests                                                    | Common Use Case                                                      |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice**          | Compares different AI voices or tones                            | Test if a friendly voice leads to higher customer engagement         |
| **Workflow**       | Tests different conversation flows or logic                      | Compare two calls scripts or routing paths                           |
| **Agent Settings** | Evaluates settings like interruption, delay, or background noise | Find the balance between quick responsed and natural flow            |
| **Knowledge Base** | Tests different documentation sources                            | See which knowlesdge sources improve the accuracy of the the answers |
| **Other**          | For any other tests outside thes categories                      |                                                                      |

| **Other**          | For any test outside these categories                            | Experiment with custom or complex configurations             |

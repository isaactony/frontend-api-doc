Phonely automatically tracks every major change you make to a workflow (agent flow) so you can safely iterate, roll back, and publish updates with confidence. This guide walks you through how to access version history, restore previous versions, rename or delete versions, and save your workflow as a reusable template.

## **1. Accessing Version History**

You can view all saved versions of your workflow — including drafts, published versions, and historical snapshots.

### **How to open Version History**

1. Open your agent’s flow editor.
2. Click drop-down icon besides the Publish button in the top-right corner.
3. From the dropdown, select **Version History**.

A panel appears showing a chronological list of all versions.

### **2. Understanding Version Types**

Inside the Version History panel, you’ll see:

- **Current Draft**\
  Your most recent, unpublished changes.
- **Published Version**\
  The live version your callers experience.
- **Previous Versions**\
  Archived snapshots created at different points in time.

Each version shows:

- Version name
- Who saved it
- Date and timestamp
- Whether it is currently published

### **3. Restoring an Older Version**

If a recent update breaks something or you want to revert to a previous design, you can restore any earlier version.

### **To restore a version:**

1. Click the **⋯ (three dots)** next to a version.
2. Choose **Restore this version**.
3. Confirm the action.

The restored version will become your new **Current Draft**, allowing you to make edits or publish it immediately.

## **4. Renaming a Version**

Clear version names make it easier to track iterations—especially in large teams.

### **To rename a version:**

1. Click the **⋯** next to the version.
2. Select **Rename version**.
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., _"Release 1.3 – New Billing Logic"_).
4. Save.

## **5. Deleting a Version**

If you have redundant or obsolete versions, you can permanently remove them.

### **To delete a version:**

1. Click the **⋯** next to the version.
2. Select **Delete version**.
3. Confirm deletion.

> **Note:** You cannot delete the currently published version.

## **6. Saving a Workflow as a Template**

Templates help you re-use successful flow structures across multiple agents or organizations. This is especially useful for:

- Standard onboarding flows
- Support triaging flows
- Outbound campaign patterns
- Multi-step verification flows

### **How to save a template**

1. In the flow editor, click **Publish**.
2. Select **Save as Template** from the dropdown.
3. Provide a template name and description.
4. Save.

Your template will now be available when creating new workflows.

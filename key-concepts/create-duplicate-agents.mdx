Agents are the core of your Phonely workspace. Each agent represents a virtual assistant that can manage calls, collect data, and automate workflows using custom call flows, knowledge sources, and integrations.

This guide explains how to **create**, **duplicate**, and **manage agents**, as well as how organizations, workflows, and phone numbers fit together in the Phonely ecosystem.

### Understanding Agents in Phonely

Each **Agent** in Phonely acts as an independent assistant with its own:

- [**Primary phone number**](/agent-design/add-manage-phone-numbers) – the number used to handle incoming and outgoing calls.
- [**Call workflows**](/key-concepts/flows/) – logic and conversation paths unique to that agent.
- [**Knowledge base**](/agent-knowledge-base/) – information the agent uses to answer questions and make decisions.
- [**Guidelines**](/agent-design/set-agent-guidelines/) – instructions for how the agent should behave and respond.
- [**Settings**](/agent-design/flow-settings/) – configurations for integrations, notifications, and post-call actions.
- [**Testing**](/testing/) - Expertiment with prompts, voices, and workflows and deploy agents with confidence.

### Creating a New Agent

You can create a new agent from scratch to handle a specific business area or campaign.

1. Navigate to the top of the main menu under the Agent section, click **Create Agent**.
2. In the **New Agent** window, choose **Create**.
3. Enter a name for your new agent.
4. Select the **Organization** this agent belongs to.

<Tip>
  If you have multiple organizations, pick the one that owns the phone number and associated data
</Tip>

5. Click **Create**.

Your new agent will appear in the agent list under the agent section, ready for configuration.

### Duplicating an Existing Agent

Duplicating an agent allows you to quickly reuse an existing setup including workflows, integrations, and voice settings without rebuilding from scratch.

1. Navigate to the top of the main menu under the Agent section, click **Create Agent**.
2. In the modal, select the **Duplicate** option.
3. Choose the **Agent** you want to duplicate from the dropdown list.
4. Select the **Organization** to assign the duplicate agent under.
5. Click **Duplicate**.

Phonely will duplicate the selected agent and append the name (copy) and inherit:

- The existing workflows.
- The voice and behavior settings.
- Any knowledge base sources or guidelines from the original.

You can then modify the duplicated agent independently - e.g., assign a new number, tweak prompts, or change post-call actions.

### Get a Phone Number

Each agent is assigned one primary phone number.\
This number is unique to the agent and determines how calls are routed and tracked.

- When creating a new agent, a number can be automatically assigned.
- You can later configure or change the number under the **Settings** tab of that agent.
- All call logs, transcripts, and reports are tied to that number and its workflows.

### Managing Knowledge Bases and Guidelines

Each agent can have its own [Knowledge Base](/agent-knowledge-base/) and [Guidelines](/agent-design/set-agent-guidelines/) to refine how it handles calls.

- **Knowledge Base:**\
  Upload or connect documents and resources the agent can use to answer customer questions.
- **Guidelines:**\
  Define tone, personality, and behavior (e.g., “Be polite but concise” or “Always verify customer identity first”).

These customizations ensure each agent operates according to you goals — for example, a legal agent may use compliance-related documents, while a support agent references FAQs.

### Managing Organizations

Organizations are the **top-level structure** in Phonely.\
They group multiple agents, workflows, and data under one account.

#### Benefits of Using Organizations:

- **Centralized management:** All agents, numbers, and billing are linked under one organization.
- **Access control:** You can manage which team members can view or edit specific agents.
- **Separation of departments:** Keep distinct data for teams (e.g., Support vs. Legal vs. Sales).
- **Consistent settings:** Shared integrations, compliance rules, and call analytics live under the same organization.

If you work with multiple clients or brands, creating a **separate organization** for each ensures data isolation and easier management. [Learn how to create and manage organizations here](/manage-account-and-organization-settings/manage-account-and-oraganization-settings/).

### Editing Agent Settings

Once your agent is created or duplicated, open it to access these sections:

- **Agent Design** - Customize call flows, redial logic, and post-call actions.
- **Knowledge Base** - Manage uploaded documents or connected data sources.
- **Settings** - Adjust integrations, notifications, and assigned phone numbers.
- **Guidelines** - Fine-tune tone, compliance, and behavior preferences.
- **Outbound calls** - Create outbound workflows and campaigns to help sales, support, and operations teams scale their outreach.
- **Testing** - Expertiment with prompts, voices, and workflows and deploy agents with confidence.

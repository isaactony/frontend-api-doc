### Version Publishing & Release Notes

When you publish a new version, Phonely automatically compares the changes against the previous version.    \
The AI then generates release notes based on the diff, summarizing what’s new or updated.

This gives teams quick insight into what changed, improves collaboration, and keeps workflow history clear and auditable.

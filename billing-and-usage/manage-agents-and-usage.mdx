3. Open the downloaded file in your preferred spreadsheet tool (e.g., Excel or Google Sheets) to analyze or share with your team.    

<Tip>
  Usage data helps you track which agents handle the most calls, making it easier to allocate minutes or identify agents that may need scaling adjustments.

### Deleting Agents

If an agent is no longer needed, you can safely delete it from your organization. Deleting an agent permanently removes its configurations, workflows, and logs associated with that agent. \
You can delete one or multiple agents at once.

1. On the **Agents** page, locate the agent(s) you want to remove.
2. Click the checkbox next to each agent’s name to select them.
3. Once selected, a toolbar will appear at the top of the list showing how many agents are selected.
4. Click **Delete agents**.
5. Confirm the deletion in the prompt that appears.

   <Tip>
     Deleted agents cannot be recovered. If you need to reuse a configuration later, consider duplicating the agent before deleting it.

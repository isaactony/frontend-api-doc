The **Plan & Billing** section in Phonely allows you to view your current subscription, track your usage, manage plan upgrades or downgrades, and review billing history.\
This page ensures you have full visibility into your organization’s call time, overage costs, and invoices.

You can access it by navigating to:\
**Settings → Plan & Billing** (top navigation bar).

### **1. Viewing Your Current Plan**

At the top of the page, you’ll find details about your **Current Plan**, including:

- **Plan Type:** Indicates your current subscription tier (e.g., Free, Starter, Professional, Business, or Enterprise).
- **Status:** Shows whether your plan is _active_, _incomplete_, or _expired_.
- **Usage Summary Bar:** Displays the total minutes used out of your included monthly allowance.
- **Renewal Date:** The date when your plan will automatically renew.
- **Manage Plan:** Click this button to view or modify your subscription.

If your plan is marked **“incomplete_expired”**, it means the billing cycle ended or payment details need to be updated.   

### **2. Understanding the Total Usage Summary**

This section provides a breakdown of how your organization is using its minutes and estimated call time savings.

It includes:

- **Total Usage:** Total number of minutes used during the current billing period.
- **Total Overage:** The number of minutes used beyond your plan’s included quota.
- **Estimated Monthly Usage:** A projection of your monthly call activity based on current patterns.
- **Cost Savings Insight:** Displays how much agent time (and equivalent cost) your AI agents have saved — e.g., _“You’ve saved nearly \$7.65 in staffing costs.”_

  <Tip>
    Monitoring this section helps you predict when you may need to upgrade your plan to avoid overage charges.

### **6. Renewal and Notifications**

Your renewal date is listed directly under your plan name. Phonely automatically renews your subscription based on your selected billing frequency.\
If your payment method fails or expires, your plan status may temporarily show **“Incomplete”** or **“Expired”** until payment is resolved.

You’ll also receive email reminders before renewal or when nearing your usage limit.

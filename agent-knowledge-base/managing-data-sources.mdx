Phonely’s Knowledge Base allows you to manage the data that powers your AI agent’s understanding. Data sources including uploaded files, blank documents, or websites - form the foundation of how your AI responds to customers with accurate, contextual information.

## Accessing the Knowledge Base

1. Navigate to **Agent Design \> Knowledge Base**.
2. You’ll see two tabs:
   - Documents – for uploaded or internally created files.
   - Websites – for external URLs and pages linked as sources.

Use the tabs at the top right to switch between Documents and Websites views.

## Managing Documents

### Uploading or Creating Documents

Phonely lets you enrich your AI’s understanding by adding content in several ways. You can upload existing documents, create new ones, or import files from connected platforms.

- **Upload File** — Upload supported file types such as **PDF, DOCX, or TXT** directly from your computer. To see step-by-step instructions and best practices, refer to the guide on [Uploading Files to the Knowledge Base](/agent-knowledge-base/upload-files).
- **Blank Document** — Create a new document directly inside Phonely for adding internal notes, FAQs, or call scripts. For more details on editing and structuring blank documents, see the guide on [Creating and Editing Blank Documents](/agent-knowledge-base/upload-documents).
- **Import from External** — Bring in content from connected sources such as LivePro. To learn how to connect and sync your external platforms, refer to [Importing External Files into Phonely](/agent-knowledge-base/import-from-external).

### Sorting and Filtering Documents

Each column header (like Name or Last Updated At) allows sorting and display options:

- Asc: Sorts in ascending order (A–Z or oldest first).
- Desc: Sorts in descending order (Z–A or newest first).
- Hide: Removes the column from the current view.

You can also use the Active filter at the top-right to show only _Active_ or _Inactive_ documents.

### Editing a Document

Blank documents can be edited directly:

1. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) beside a file.
2. Select Edit.
3. Make changes within the editor window and save them.

### Activating or Deactivating Documents

Each document has an Active toggle to control whether it’s included in AI responses.

- To deactivate, switch off the toggle or select multiple files and click Deactivate.
  - A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **Deactivate** to confirm.
  - The document will remain stored but won’t be used for AI responses.
- To activate, select an inactive file and click **Activate**.
  - Confirm the prompt to re-enable its use in AI-generated replies.

This helps when you want to pause the use of older materials without deleting them.

### Downloading or Deleting Documents

You can retrieve or permanently remove files as needed:

- Download:
  1. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) beside a document.
  2. Select Download to save the file locally.
- Delete:
  1. Select one or more documents.
  2. Click Delete at the bottom of the screen.
  3. Confirm deletion.

## Managing Website Sources

### Adding a Website

You can add a new website as a knowledge source by entering its URL and display name under the **Websites** tab — to learn the full setup process and management options, see the guide on [Adding Website Sources](/agent-knowledge-base/add-websites).

### Editing a Website

Websites can be edited to update content, replace URLs, or revise extracted text.

1. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) beside the website entry.
2. Select Edit.
3. In the editor, modify the extracted content, add notes, or correct links.
4. Click Publish to apply updates, or Save as Draft to continue later.

This allows you to refine imported data or manually edit how website content is represented.

### Activating or Deactivating Websites

Just like documents, websites can be toggled active or inactive:

- **Deactivate**: Turn off the toggle or select entries and click Deactivate.
  - Confirm in the dialog box.
  - The site will remain listed but its data will be excluded from AI responses.
- **Activate**: Reactivate by turning on the toggle or selecting and clicking Activate.
  - Confirm in the popup.
  - The content will once again feed into your AI agent’s knowledge context.

Use this to temporarily pause or resume specific website sources without deleting them.

### Deleting a Website

To remove a website permanently:

1. Select the checkbox beside one or more URLs.
2. Click **Delete** at the bottom of the page.
3. Confirm the action.

### Filtering and Sorting Websites

Use the Filter websites… bar to search by name or URL.\
You can also filter by Active/Inactive using the toggle menu at the top right.\
Sort columns (Name, URL, Last Updated At) in ascending or descending order for better navigation.

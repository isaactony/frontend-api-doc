You can connect Phonely to external platforms to automatically import your existing documentation and make it available for your AI agent. This is especially useful if your company already maintains a centralized knowledge base elsewhere, such as **LivePro**.

## Open the Knowledge Base

From the left sidebar, go to **Agent Design \> Knowledge Base**, then switch to the **Knowledge Base** tab. Here, you’ll see all your data sources, including uploaded and created documents.

## Click “Import from External

At the top of the page, click **Import from External**.\
A modal will appear displaying available integration options - for now, Phonely supports importing from LivePro.       

## Connect to LivePro

Select **LivePro** and click **Connect**.   \
You’ll be prompted to enter the following details:      

- **Domain:** Your LivePro workspace domain (e.g., `https://your-domain.com`).
- **API Key:** Your LivePro API key to authorize the integration.    

Once filled, click **Continue** to connect your account.

## Import Your Documents

After connecting successfully, Phonely will retrieve your LivePro documents.\
You can then select which files to import into your **Data Sources** list.

Your imported documents will appear alongside your existing ones, ready for your AI agent to use in answering questions.

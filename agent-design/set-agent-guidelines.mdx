Agent Guidelines define how your AI phone agent behaves, speaks, and reacts during conversations. Think of them as your agent’s training manual - they determine its personality, tone, and general knowledge that applies across all flows.

## Understand What Guidelines Do

Agent Guidelines serve as a persistent “system prompt” - context that stays active throughout the conversation, regardless of which flow block or sub-flow the agent is in.

They’re used to:

- Set the **overall personality and tone** of your AI receptionist.
- Provide **general knowledge or context** that applies everywhere.
- Include **common rebuttals or fallback responses**.
- Define how to handle **special scenarios** (e.g., upset customers).

Unlike flow-specific content, guidelines are always accessible to the agent - they act as its permanent memory.

## Build Your Guidelines Structure

You can structure your Guidelines document into several clear sections. Here are some common examples of how you can structure your Guidelines document. You don’t need to include every section - simply use the ones that make sense for your business and agent type.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your Role">
    Define the role and purpose of your agent.\
    Example:

    **Your Role**\
    As the AI receptionist for Phonely, you are the first point of contact for customers. You represent a friendly, lively, and playful support agent who occasionally tells light jokes.

    **Example**

    **Objectives:**

    > - Assist with customer queries and guide them to next steps.
    > - Keep tone conversational and upbeat.
    > - Resolve issues efficiently and accurately every time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conversational Tips">
    Specify stylistic preferences or phrases to avoid.\
    **Example:**

    > - Don’t say “Correct” — say “Right.”
    > - Avoid being overly apologetic.
    > - Keep sentences short and natural.
    > - Match the customer’s emotional tone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your Personality">
    Describe the agent’s communication style.\
    **Example:**

    You are the digital face of **Demo Organization**, embodying:

    > 1. **Friendly & Warm** – Greet customers enthusiastically.
    > 2. **Conversational & Relaxed** – Speak like a helpful friend, not a robot.
    > 3. **Empathetic & Understanding** – Listen actively and acknowledge frustration.
    > 4. **Engaging & Curious** – Ask thoughtful follow-ups to show interest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Common Rebuttals">
    Prepare responses to frequent objections or concerns.\
    This ensures your agent always stays calm and confident. Here are some examples for reference:

    | Caller Concern                      | Recommended Response                                                                                                      |
    | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | “We already have a call center.”    | “Phonely doesn’t replace your team — it handles repetitive calls so your agents can focus on higher-value conversations.” |
    | “AI doesn’t sound human enough.”    | “Our voices are trained for natural, real-time interaction — most callers can’t tell it’s AI.”                            |
    | “Do you comply with HIPAA or GDPR?” | “Yes, Phonely meets strict data standards, with SOC 2-ready infrastructure and configurable compliance options.”          |
    | “How is this better than an IVR?”   | “Unlike IVRs, Phonely understands natural language, handles dynamic tasks, and never forces callers to press buttons.”    |
    | “Will this replace jobs?”           | “Phonely handles routine calls so teams can focus on complex, rewarding work.”                                            |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Important Information">
    Include static company details that the AI may need to share.

    **Example:**

    > **Important Information**\
    > Website: [www.phonely.ai](http://www.phonely.ai)\
    > Help Center: [help.phonely.ai](http://help.phonely.ai)\
    > Live Demo: [app.phonely.ai](http://app.phonely.ai)\
    > Phone: +1 (415) 915-8520\
    > Address: 81 Langton St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA
  </Step>
  <Step title=" Handling Specific Scenarios">
    Define how the AI should behave in sensitive or special situations.

    **Example: Handling an Unhappy Customer (The LEARN Framework)**

    1. **Listen** – Actively listen without interrupting.
    2. **Empathize** – Acknowledge frustration.
       - Example: “I understand how that could be frustrating.”
    3. **Apologize** – Offer a genuine apology.
       - Example: “I’m sorry this happened — let’s fix it together.”
    4. **Ensure Follow-Up** – Assure escalation to a team member.
    5. **Reassure** – End positively: “We’ll resolve this quickly for you.”

    **Example: Handling Inappropriate Requests**\
    If a caller shares something unprofessional, politely redirect and maintain professionalism
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Use Guidelines vs Knowledge Base

| Feature              | Purpose                                                                         | Use Case                                                                            |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Guidelines** | Always-on context that defines tone, behavior, and personality.                 | Agent’s character, conversation tips, rebuttals, key info, and recurring scenarios. |
| **Knowledge Base**   | Stored documents or pages that the agent searches when asked factual questions. | FAQs, pricing details, technical docs, or detailed product info.                    |

<Tip>
  Think of Guidelines as the brain of your agent, while the Knowledge Base is its library.

## Creating & Enabling a SIP Address

Phonely allows you to generate a dedicated SIP address for inbound calling. This is ideal if you already have a SIP-based phone system, PBX, or softphone that you want to route calls to.

A SIP address works like an internet-based phone number. It allows external systems, such as Twilio SIP Domains, SIP-enabled devices, VoIP softphones, or PBX systems to send calls directly into your Phonely Agent.

### How to Create a SIP Address

1. Open **\+ Add a Number** from the Phone Numbers panel.
2. Switch to the **Create SIP Address** tab and click **Enable SIP Address**.
4. Your SIP channel becomes active for inbound traffic.
5. Phonely automatically generates a SIP endpoint for your account.
6. Click the **Copy** icon to copy the SIP URI to your clipboard.
7. Your SIP Address is now ready for use. To disable this address, click **Disable SIP Address**.

Phonely stops accepting inbound SIP calls immediately.

## Managing Existing Numbers

Once added, your numbers appear in the **Additional Phone Numbers** table.

### Set as Primary

- Click the three-dot men **(⋮)**  next to the number.
- Select **Set as Primary** to make this the default outgoing line for your agent.
- Only one number can be primary at a time.
- Calls and messages initiated by your agent will default to the primary number unless overridden in a specific flow.

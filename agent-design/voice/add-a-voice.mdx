### Add the Voice ID

After selecting the provider, you’ll see an **Add ID** field.

Paste your **voice ID** from the provider’s platform (e.g., from your 11 Labs account).

- This ID uniquely identifies the voice you want to import.

Double-check that the ID is correct to ensure the voice loads successfully.

### Select a Language

Choose the **Language** in which the voice will operate.

Available options may include: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Dutch, Swedish, and Danish

Select the language that best matches your voice model or intended audience.

### Confirm and Add the Voice

Review your selections (Provider, ID, Language).

Click **\+ Add Voice** to finalize the process.

The new voice will now appear in your Voice Library under _Explore All Voices_.

### Manage and Use the New Voice

Once added, you can:

- **Preview** the voice by clicking the play button.
- **Set it as default** by clicking **Select**.
- **Add to Favorites** by tapping the heart icon ❤️.
- **Edit settings** (e.g., tone, speed, or pitch) using the gear icon ⚙️ if available.

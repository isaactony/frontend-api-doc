    - **Explore All Voices** — A searchable, filterable list of every available voice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selecting and Previewing a Voice">
    Each voice card includes:

    - A Play button to preview how it sounds.
    - Tags showing its accent, gender, and supported languages.
    - A heart icon to mark it as a favorite for quick access later.

    Click **Select** to assign the voice to your AI agent. The selected voice will show a “Selected” badge under **Actions**.

    You can also clone an existing voice by clicking **Clone Voice** (top-right) if you want to create a custom variation. For more details on how you can clone your voice please refer to thsi guide.

  <Step title=" Accessing Voice Settings2. Searching and Filtering Voices">
    To find the perfect match for your AI agent:

    - **Search:** Use the search bar at the top to quickly locate a specific voice by name.
    - **Filters:** Click **Filters** to narrow results by attributes such as:
      - **Language:** e.g., English, Spanish, French, Hungarian

      - **Provider Tags:** Such as _11Labs_, _OpenAI Realtime_, or _Multi-Lingual_

  </Step>
  <Step title="Customizing the Voice">
    Once a voice is selected, click the **Settings cogwheel** next to it to open **Voice Customization**.

    Here, you can fine-tune how the AI sounds during calls:

    - **Speed:** Adjust the speaking pace using a slider (e.g., 1.15× for slightly faster delivery).
    - **Tags Overview:** Review key traits such as language, provider, or model type.
    - **Multi-Lingual Support:** Toggle this setting on to enable the AI to speak and understand multiple languages seamlessly.

    When done, click **Save Settings** to apply your customizations.

  <Step title="Managing and Organizing Voices">
    You can:

    - **Add New Voices** — Use the **\+ Add Voice** button to upload or import new voices.
    - **Mark Favorites** — Click the heart icon to save preferred voices.
    - **View Usage Metrics** — Check how many minutes each voice has been used and its total call duration under the **Used** and **Duration** columns.
  </Step>

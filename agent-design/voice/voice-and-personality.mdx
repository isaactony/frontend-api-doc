## Add Office Noise

This feature adds light background sound to mimic a real-world environment, making your agent’s voice sound more authentic and less “studio-perfect.”                \
It’s useful when you want your conversations to feel natural and comfortable for the caller.

1. Open the **Voice & Personality** tab.
3. Under **Add Office Noise**, click the dropdown menu.

### Options

You can choose from:

- **None (default):** No background noise; your agent’s voice is clean and clear.\
  Best for formal or quiet interactions such as customer support or technical assistance.
- **Office Space:** Adds a realistic office background sound (e.g., subtle typing or chatter).\
  Ideal for professional or corporate support environments.
- **Soft Office Space:** Adds a gentler ambient noise for a natural but calm tone.      \
  Best for relaxed or friendly interactions like onboarding or sales calls.

## Humanize Conversation

Enable this option to add subtle vocal elements, such as _“hmm,” “uh,” “let’s see,”_  to make your agent sound more human-like and less robotic. It mimics natural pauses and filler words found in real speech.

### How to Enable

1. Locate **Humanize Conversation** in the Voice & Personality settings.
2. Toggle the switch on to enable it.
3. Your agent will begin incorporating natural speech patterns during conversations.

<Tip>
  Recommended for casual, friendly, or customer engagement calls. Avoid using it for formal or compliance-related conversations.

## Phonetic Dictionary

The Phonetic Dictionary allows you to fine-tune pronunciation for specific words, names, or brands ensuring your agent says them correctly and naturally.

This is especially helpful for:

- **Company names** (e.g., “Phonely” pronounced as “Fone-lee”).
- **Acronyms** (e.g., “MFA” pronounced “Em-Eff-Ay”).
- Foreign or uncommon names.

### How It Works

You define how a word should be pronounced using phonemes (sound-based syllables).   \
Phonely supports standard phonetic notation systems, such as MFA (Montreal Forced Aligner).

### How to Add a New Word

1. Scroll to the **Phonetic Dictionary** section.
2. In the **Word** field, type the term you want to adjust.
3. In the **Phonemes** field, enter the pronunciation.
4. Click **\+ Add Word** to save it.

<Note>
  Example: /f oʊ n l i/ 
</Note>

The **Voice & Personality** tab in Phonely allows you to customize how your AI agent sounds and behaves during a conversation. These settings help create a more natural, brand-aligned voice experience — whether you want your agent to sound professional, friendly, or casual.

You can control:

- The background environment (office ambiance).
- The agent’s tone and communication style.
- Whether to include human-like speech fillers.
- How your agent pronounces words through a Phonetic Dictionary.

## Add Office Noise

This feature adds light background sound to mimic a real-world environment, making your agent’s voice sound more authentic and less “studio-perfect.”                \
It’s useful when you want your conversations to feel natural and comfortable for the caller.

1. Open the **Voice & Personality** tab.
3. Under **Add Office Noise**, click the dropdown menu.

### Options

You can choose from:

- **None (default)** — No background noise; your agent’s voice is clean and clear.\
  Best for formal or quiet interactions such as customer support or technical assistance.
- **Office Space** — Adds a realistic office background sound (e.g., subtle typing or chatter).\
  Ideal for professional or corporate support environments.
- **Soft Office Space** — Adds a gentler ambient noise for a natural but calm tone.\
  Best for relaxed or friendly interactions like onboarding or sales calls.

## Humanize Conversation

Enable this option to add subtle vocal elements — such as _“hmm,” “uh,” “let’s see,”_ — to make your agent sound more human-like and less robotic.\
It mimics natural pauses and filler words found in real speech.

### How to Enable

1. Locate **Humanize Conversation** in the Voice & Personality settings.
2. Toggle the switch on to enable it.
3. Your agent will begin incorporating natural speech patterns during conversations.

<Tip>
  Recommended for casual, friendly, or customer engagement calls. Avoid using it for formal or compliance-related conversations.

## Phonetic Dictionary

The Phonetic Dictionary allows you to fine-tune pronunciation for specific words, names, or brands — ensuring your agent says them correctly and naturally.

This is especially helpful for:

- **Company names** (e.g., “Phonely” pronounced as “Fone-lee”).
- **Acronyms** (e.g., “MFA” pronounced “Em-Eff-Ay”).
- **Foreign or uncommon names. **

### How It Works

You define how a word should be pronounced using phonemes (sound-based syllables).\
Phonely supports standard phonetic notation systems, such as MFA (Montreal Forced Aligner).

### How to Add a New Word

1. Scroll to the **Phonetic Dictionary** section.
2. In the **Word** field, type the term you want to adjust.
3. In the **Phonemes** field, enter the pronunciation.
   - Example: `/f oʊ n l i/`
4. Click **\+ Add Word** to save it.

You can add as many words as needed, and they’ll apply globally across all calls for that agent.

  Use this feature to maintain consistent pronunciation for your brand and technical terms.

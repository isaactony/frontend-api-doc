The **Voice & Personality** tab in Phonely allows you to customize how your AI agent sounds and behaves during a conversation. These settings help create a more natural, brand-aligned voice experience — whether you want your agent to sound professional, friendly, or casual.

You can control:

- The **background environment** (office ambiance)
- The **agent’s tone and communication style**
- Whether to include **human-like speech fillers**
- How your agent **pronounces words** through a **Phonetic Dictionary**

## **1. Add Office Noise**

### **Purpose**

This feature adds light background sound to mimic a real-world environment, making your agent’s voice sound more authentic and less “studio-perfect.”\
It’s useful when you want your conversations to feel natural and comfortable for the caller.

### **Options**

You can choose from:

- **None (default)** — No background noise; your agent’s voice is clean and clear.\
  _Best for formal or quiet interactions such as customer support or technical assistance._
- **Office Space** — Adds a realistic office background sound (e.g., subtle typing or chatter).\
  _Ideal for professional or corporate support environments._
- **Soft Office Space** — Adds a gentler ambient noise for a natural but calm tone.\
  _Best for relaxed or friendly interactions like onboarding or sales calls._

### **How to Configure**

1. Open the **Voice & Personality** tab.
2. Under **Add Office Noise**, click the dropdown menu.
3. Select your preferred option: **None**, **Office Space**, or **Soft Office Space**.
4. The change applies immediately after saving or publishing your settings.

> 💡 _Tip: Try “Soft Office Space” for a balance between professionalism and warmth._

## **3. Humanize Conversation**

### **Purpose**

Enable this option to add subtle vocal elements — such as _“hmm,” “uh,” “let’s see,”_ — to make your agent sound more human-like and less robotic.\
It mimics natural pauses and filler words found in real speech.

### **How to Enable**

1. Locate **Humanize Conversation** in the Voice & Personality settings.
2. Toggle the switch **on** to enable it.
3. Your agent will begin incorporating natural speech patterns during conversations.

<Tip>
  Recommended for casual, friendly, or customer engagement calls. Avoid using it for formal or compliance-related conversations.

## **4. Phonetic Dictionary**

### **Purpose**

The **Phonetic Dictionary** allows you to fine-tune pronunciation for specific words, names, or brands — ensuring your agent says them correctly and naturally.

This is especially helpful for:

- **Company names** (e.g., “Phonely” pronounced as “Fone-lee”)
- **Acronyms** (e.g., “MFA” pronounced “Em-Eff-Ay”)
- **Foreign or uncommon names**

### **How It Works**

You define how a word should be pronounced using **phonemes** (sound-based syllables).\
Phonely supports standard phonetic notation systems, such as **MFA (Montreal Forced Aligner)**.

### **How to Add a New Word**

1. Scroll to the **Phonetic Dictionary** section.
2. In the **Word** field, type the term you want to adjust.
   - Example: _Phonely_
3. In the **Phonemes** field, enter the pronunciation.
   - Example: `/f oʊ n l i/`
4. Click **\+ Add Word** to save it.

You can add as many words as needed, and they’ll apply globally across all calls for that agent.

<Tip>
  Use this feature to maintain consistent pronunciation for your brand and technical terms.

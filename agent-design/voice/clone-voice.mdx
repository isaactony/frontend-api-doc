Phonely allows you to clone a custom voice so your AI agent can sound more personalized or closely match your brand’s tone. This process involves uploading or recording a short audio sample, selecting voice parameters, and finalizing the cloned voice for use.

  <Step title=" Open the Voice Library">
    From the **Agent Design** page, click on the **Choose a Voice** section.\
    Once the **Voice Library** opens, click **Clone Voice** at the top-right corner of the window.

    This opens the Create Your Voice Clone window, where you’ll provide and audio sample and define key voice settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload or Record a Voice Sample">
    You can add a voice sample in one of two ways:

    - **Record Audio:** Click **Record Audio** to capture your sample directly within Phonely.

    <Tip>

  <Step title="Provide Voice Details">
    Next, fill in the required details to define your voice profile:

    - **Name:** Give your cloned voice a name.
    - **Gender:** Select the gender that best represents the voice (e.g., Male, Female).
    - **Language**: Choose the language the voice will primarily speak. Supported languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Dutch, Swedish, and Danish.

    Check the **Agree** box to confirm that you have permission to use and clone the provided voice sample and that it will not be used for illegal or harmful purposes.

    - **Preview** it by clicking the **Play** button.
    - Set it as your active agent voice by clicking **Select** under the **Actions** column.
    - Further customize it by clicking the Settings icon to adjust speed or multilingual options.

## **Call Settings Overview**

Below is a breakdown of each setting available in this panel and how it affects call behavior.

### **1. Call Recordings**

When enabled, Phonely records all incoming and outgoing calls for future review. Transcripts are still available even if recording is turned off.

**Impact:**

- Turning this off disables audio recording but keeps text transcripts active.
- Recommended to **enable** for quality assurance and training.
- Ensure compliance with local regulations on call recording before enabling.

### **2. Record Post Transfer**

Allows recording to continue even after a call has been transferred to a human agent. Viewable in call history recording. You must inform the Transferee (person being transferred to) that the call is being recorded.

**Impact:**

- Captures the entire conversation history, including transferred segments.
- Must inform the transferee (the person being transferred to) that the call is recorded for compliance.
- Useful for full-context audits of customer interactions.

### **3. Max Call Duration**

Defines the maximum time a caller can remain on a call with Phonely.\
The default duration is 20 minutes, adjustable up to 60 minutes.

**Impact:**

- Prevents agents from being stuck in long or idle calls.
- Automatically ends the call once the set time is reached.
- When the limit is hit, Phonely will say the **Max Duration Message** (editable text field below the slider).

> Example message:\
> “I apologize, but we’ve reached the maximum duration for this call. Thank you for your time.”

### **4. End Immediately**

When enabled, the call ends instantly after reaching the call limit — skipping any closing message.

**Impact:**

- Faster termination of calls (no goodbye message).
- Use for automated call centers or transactional systems that don’t need closing dialogue.

### **5. Silence Detection**

Determines how the agent reacts to extended silence during calls.

**Parameters:**

- **Silence Timeout:** Number of seconds Phonely will wait before speaking again (e.g., 15s).
- **Max Retries:** Number of times the agent checks in with the caller before ending the call.

**Impact:**

- Prevents long pauses and improves engagement.
- Helps the agent re-engage distracted callers.
- If silence persists after max retries, Phonely will end the call politely.

### 6. HIPAA Compliance

Ensures your agent operates under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) standards when handling sensitive medical information.

**Impact:**

- Available only on **Enterprise Plans**.
- Requires a signed **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with Phonely.
- Once enabled, call data is encrypted, audit logs are activated, and non-compliant integrations are restricted.

**How to Enable:**

1. Click the HIPAA Compliance toggle.
2. A verification modal appears:

   > “This feature requires an enterprise plan to enable. Talk to a Phonely team member to add this to your account.”
3. Click **Talk to Sales** to contact the Phonely team.

### **7. PCI Compliance**

Applies Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) for businesses that handle payment information.

**Impact:**

- Masks sensitive card details and prevents them from being transcribed or logged.
- Only PCI-certified integrations can process call data.
- Audio and transcript storage is fully encrypted.
- Available on **Enterprise Plan only**.

**How to Enable:**

1. Click the **PCI Compliance** toggle.
2. A prompt appears:

   > “This feature requires an enterprise plan to enable. Talk to a Phonely team member to add this to your account.”
3. Click **Talk to Sales** to request activation.

### **8. Agent Timezone**

Sets the local timezone your agent uses for scheduling and timestamping call activity.

**Impact:**

- Affects how call logs, schedules, and reports appear in the dashboard.
- Ensure this matches your team’s operational timezone (e.g., **Nairobi (EAT) GMT+03:00**).

### **9. Additional Phone Numbers**

Manage multiple phone numbers connected to your Phonely Agent. You can add new numbers, rename them, or assign them to specific flows.

**Impact:**

- Enables dedicated lines for different departments or campaigns.
- Allows scaling with multiple numbers under one agent.

**How to Add a Number:**

1. Scroll to **Additional Phone Numbers** at the bottom of the Call Settings page.
2. Click **\+ Add a Number**.
3. Choose a number, assign a name, and save.

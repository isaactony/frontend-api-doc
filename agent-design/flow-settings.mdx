The **Flow Settings** panel allows you to customize each call flow with the specific context, resources, and configurations it needs to perform correctly. These settings define how your agent behaves, what reference materials it can use, and how it transitions between flows.

### **Flow Specific Information**

Use this field to provide additional details or context about the purpose of your flow. This information helps your AI agent understand the flow’s intent and ensures that responses remain accurate and relevant.

Example:

> “This flow handles customer support inquiries for billing, refunds, and subscription upgrades..."

### **Include Guidelines**

Enable this option to apply the Guidelines set in your agent guidelines file.\
This ensures that tone, style, and phrasing stay consistent across all calls — whether the agent is handling support, sales, or appointment scheduling.

- When checked, the AI automatically follows the rules defined in your **Agent Guidelines**.
- When unchecked, the flow will operate independently without enforced guidelines.

### **Documents**

Attach one or more **Documents** that the flow can reference during live calls.\
These may include FAQs, product manuals, legal disclaimers, or training materials.

**How to use:**

1. Click **Documents**.
2. Choose specific files you want the AI Agent to access.
3. Save your selection.

### **Websites**

Select the websites that the agent can use as additional reference sources when responding during calls.

**How to use:**

1. Click **Websites**.
2. Pick specific sites relevant to this flow, such as your company knowledge base or product documentation portal.
3. Save your selection.

For example:

> Choose “Phonely AI” and “Google Workspace Support” if your agent helps users troubleshoot integrations with Google apps.

### **Switch Message**

The **Switch Message** defines what your AI agent says while transitioning to this flow.\
This ensures callers experience a natural, professional pause while context loads in the background.

**Example**:

> “One moment please, I’m connecting you to our scheduling assistant.”

You can customize this to fit your tone or scenario (e.g., “Let me transfer you to our billing department.”).

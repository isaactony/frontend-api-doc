### Flow Specific Information

Use this field to provide additional details or context about the purpose of your flow. This information helps your AI agent understand the flow’s intent and ensures that responses remain accurate and relevant.  

Example:

> _“This flow handles customer support inquiries for billing, refunds, and subscription upgrades..."_

### Include Guidelines

Enable this option to apply the Guidelines set in your agent guidelines file.\
This ensures that tone, style, and phrasing stay consistent across all calls, whether the agent is handling support, sales, or appointment scheduling.

- When checked, the AI automatically follows the rules defined in your **Agent Guidelines**.
- When unchecked, the flow will operate independently without enforced guidelines.

### Switch Message

The **Switch Message** defines what your AI agent says while transitioning to this flow.\
This ensures callers experience a natural, professional pause while context loads in the background.

**Example**:

> _“One moment please, I’m connecting you to our scheduling assistant.”_

You can customize this to fit your tone or scenario (e.g., “Let me transfer you to our billing department.”).

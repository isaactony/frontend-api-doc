## **Accessing the Call History Page**

2. You’ll see a **table view** listing all calls made or received by your Phonely agents.
   - Each row includes:
     - Date & Time
     - Business Number
     - Customer Number
     - Duration
     - Topic
     - Sentiment
     - Ended Reason
     - Outcome

<Tip>

</Tip>

##  **Filtering & Sorting Calls**

Use the **Filters panel** to quickly refine your search and uncover the calls that matter most.

### Available Filters:

- **Duration:** Filter by call length using the time slider (e.g., 0–10 minutes+)
- **Unread / Read:** Show only new or previously reviewed calls
- **Sentiment:** Focus on _Positive_, _Neutral_, or _Negative_ customer interactions
- **Outcome:** Filter by workflow outcomes like _End Call_, _Greeting Hangup_, _Appointment Scheduled_, or _Lead Qualified_
- **Ended Reason:** See whether calls were _Customer Ended_, _Phonely Ended_, _Timeout_, or _Transfer_
- **Call Type:** Separate _Inbound_, _Outbound_, and _Web Calls_
- **Mode:** Distinguish between _Call_ or _Messaging_ sessions

You can also click **View \> Toggle Columns** to customize which fields are displayed, such as A/B Test, Last Block, or Version.

## **Reviewing Call Details**

Click any call row to open the **Call Detail View**.\
You’ll find three tabs at the top: **Highlights**, **Transcript**, and **Blocks**.

![Call History Blocks Gi](/assets/call-history-blocks.gif)

### **1. Highlights Tab**

Displays a summarized view of the entire call:

- **Call Summary** – A quick narrative describing what the call was about.
- **Caller Details** – The caller’s phone number and detected location.
- **Call Stats** – Sentiment, end reason, duration, topic, and final outcome.

### **2. Transcript Tab**

The **Transcript** provides a turn-by-turn record of the conversation.

- Each Phonely message and user response is timestamped.
- Stored variables (like `caller_reason` or `room_type`) appear inline.
- “View Reasoning” shows the AI’s decision-making process in real time - Phonely’s **real-time reasoning** feature explains _why_ the AI responded a certain way.
- Checkboxes indicate **endpoint detection**, marking pauses or timeouts in conversation.

### **3. Blocks Tab**

The **Blocks** tab breaks the conversation down into the individual workflow blocks used during the call.

Each block displays:

- **Block Name and Status** (e.g., Greeting Message → Completed)
- **AI Speech** and **User Input** text
- **Variables Extracted** during the exchange
- **Reasoning** that explains AI intent detection or clarification logic

Example:

> - **Block:** _Identify Purpose_
> - **AI Speech:** “Could you tell me a bit more about your inquiry?”
> - **Extracted Variable:** `caller_reason: “Enquiring about a room”`

This view is especially helpful when debugging or optimizing your call flows.

## **Understanding Call Path Analytics**

Click the **Call Path** tab at the top of the Call History page to visualize how conversations progress through your workflows.

Each node in the diagram represents a block or workflow segment, while the connecting lines show call progression between them.

![Call Path Gi](/assets/call-path.gif)

### **What You’ll See**

- **Start Node** – Entry point of all calls (shows total call count and average duration).
- **Workflow Nodes** – Represent steps like  _Reception Flow_, or _AI Receptionist_.
- **End Node** – Displays success rate, total calls ended, and end reasons (e.g., _AI Hang Up_, _Customer Ended_).

You can use filters here to focus on:

- A specific date range
- Certain workflows (e.g., Appointment Booking vs. Legal Reception)
- Calls that share the same outcome or end reason

### **Why It’s Important**

- Identify where most calls are ending (e.g., 32% ending before booking).
- Spot bottlenecks or prompt issues.
- Measure success rates per workflow.

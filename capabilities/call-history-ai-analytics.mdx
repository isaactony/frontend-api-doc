</Tip>

Use the **Filters panel** to quickly refine your search and uncover the calls that matter most.

### Available Filters:

- **Duration:** Filter by call length using the time slider (e.g., 0–10 minutes+)
- **Unread / Read:** Show only new or previously reviewed calls
- **Sentiment:** Focus on _Positive_, _Neutral_, or _Negative_ customer interactions
- **Outcome:** Filter by workflow outcomes like _End Call_, _Greeting Hangup_, _Appointment Scheduled_, or _Lead Qualified_
- **Ended Reason:** See whether calls were _Customer Ended_, _Phonely Ended_, _Timeout_, or _Transfer_
- **Call Type:** Separate _Inbound_, _Outbound_, and _Web Calls_
- **Mode:** Distinguish between _Call_ or _Messaging_ sessions

You can also click **View \> Toggle Columns** to customize which fields are displayed, such as A/B Test, Last Block, or Version.

## **Reviewing Call Details**

Click any call row to open the **Call Detail View**.\
You’ll find three tabs at the top: **Highlights**, **Transcript**, and **Blocks**.

![Call History Blocks Gi](/assets/call-history-blocks.gif)

### **1. Highlights Tab**

Displays a summarized view of the entire call:

- **Call Summary** – A quick narrative describing what the call was about.
- **Caller Details** – The caller’s phone number and detected location.
- **Call Stats** – Sentiment, end reason, duration, topic, and final outcome.

### **2. Transcript Tab**

The **Transcript** provides a turn-by-turn record of the conversation.

- Each Phonely message and user response is timestamped.
- Stored variables (like `caller_reason` or `room_type`) appear inline.
- “View Reasoning” shows the AI’s decision-making process in real time - Phonely’s real-time reasoning feature explains why the AI responded a certain way.
- Checkboxes indicate endpoint detection, marking pauses or timeouts in conversation.

### **3. Blocks Tab**

The **Blocks** tab breaks the conversation down into the individual workflow blocks used during the call.

Each block displays:

- **Block Name and Status**. 
- **AI Speech** and **User Input** text
- **Variables Extracted** during the exchange
- **Reasoning** that explains AI intent detection or clarification logic

This view is especially helpful when debugging or optimizing your call flows.

## Exporting Selected Calls and Running Reports

The **Export** and **Report** options allow you to analyze call performance or share data externally.

### A) Export Selected Calls

Use **Export Selected Calls** when you want to download specific calls manually from the list.

1. From the **Call History** table, check the calls you want to include.
   - You can select one or multiple rows.
2. Click **Export Selected Calls**.
   - This action downloads a **CSV file** containing detailed data for only those calls.

### B) Running a Report

Use **Run Report** to generate an automatic summary of all calls that match your **filters and date range** - no manual selection needed.

1. At the top of the Call History page, apply the desired date range. 
2. Once your filters are set, click Run Report in the bottom toolbar.
3. Phonely will automatically generate a Call Report summarizing those filtered calls.

### D) Downloading Report Data

You can download your report in two formats:

- **Raw Data (CSV)** – Contains every individual call and all details, perfect for deeper review in Excel or Sheets.
- **Summary Stats (JSON)** – Contains aggregated metrics only (totals, averages, outcomes), useful for analytics tools or dashboards.

Simply click the **Download CSV** or **Download JSON** button from the Call Report panel.                                                        

## **Understanding Call Path Analytics**

Click the **Call Path** tab at the top of the Call History page to visualize how conversations progress through your workflows.            

Each node in the diagram represents a block or workflow segment, while the connecting lines show call progression between them.

![Call Path Gi](/assets/call-path.gif)

### **What You’ll See**

- **Start Node** – Entry point of all calls (shows total call count and average duration).
- **Workflow Nodes** – Represent steps like  _Reception Flow_, or _AI Receptionist_.
- **End Node** – Displays success rate, total calls ended, and end reasons (e.g., _AI Hang Up_, _Customer Ended_).

You can use filters here to focus on:           

- A specific date range.         
- Your workflows (e.g., Appointment Booking vs. Legal Reception)
- Calls that share the same outcome or end reason

## Example Use Cases
                                  
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Appointment Scheduling">
    Use call paths to track how effectively appointment scheduling calls are processed and identify areas for improvement.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Lead Qualification">
    Analyze call endings to refine lead qualification prompts and reduce call drop-off rates.
  </Tab>   
</Tabs>

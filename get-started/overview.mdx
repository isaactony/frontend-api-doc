## What is Phonely?

Phonely is the easiest way to build conversational voice agents that answer and place phone calls. You get the full conversation stack out-of-the-box: voice, reasoning, routing, integrations, analytics so you can go from idea to a production agent in minutes, not months.

With Phonely you can:

- Have natural, low-latency phone conversations
- Make and receive calls on Phonely numbers or your carrier
- Qualify, route, schedule, and escalate to humans on rules you define
- Integrate with calendars, CRMs, APIs, and internal tools
- Track performance with rich call analytics, A/B testing, and call paths

## **Overview**

The Flow Canvas includes several utility tools to help you:

- Navigate the canvas
- Select and move individual nodes
- Organize your workflow visually
- Export a snapshot of your layout
- Undo or redo actions
- Track recent changes

Each tool serves a different purpose, and understanding them will make editing faster and more intuitive.

## Canvas Toolbar 

The vertical toolbar on the left provides your main navigation and interaction modes.

### Hand Mode (Drag the Canvas)

Use this mode when you want to **move the entire canvas** instead of moving nodes.

**When to use it:               **

- Navigating large flows.                                                                                                                            
- Panning around to find other sections.                         
- Reviewing branches without disturbing blocks.                          

**How it works:**\
Click the hand icon → click and drag anywhere → the whole canvas moves.\
Nodes stay in place.     

### Pointer Mode (Select & Move Nodes)

Pointer mode allows you to **select, reposition, and interact with individual nodes**.

**Use this to:**

- Move nodes. 
- Click into blocks to open the editor.      
- Create or remove connections.     
- Highlight multiple nodes (click + shift).                       

This is the primary mode for editing your workflow structure.

### Export View (Save Canvas as PNG)

This tool lets you export your **current canvas view as a PNG image**.

Useful for:           

Sharing flow diagrams with teams.                                                                           

- Sharing flow diagrams with team members.  
- Including flow visuals in documentation or presentations.  
- Capturing a snapshot before major edits.    

The export captures exactly what you see on the screen.

## Organize Nodes (Auto-Arrange)

Automatically arranges your nodes for a **cleaner, more readable layout**.

**What it does:**

- Repositions nodes into a tidy structure. 
- Reduces visual clutter. 
- Helps you see long flows more clearly.              

### **History & Editing Controls (Bottom Left)**

These controls help you manage changes safely.

### **Undo**

Reverts your most recent action.

Undo supports actions like:

- Moving a node
- Reconnecting blocks
- Deleting or adding a connection
- Adjusting layout position

Great when you make a mistake or want to quickly revert a change.

### **Redo**

Restores an action you previously undone.

Useful when:

- You undo too far
- You want to compare two changes
- You change your mind mid-edit

### Change History Panel

Shows a list of your **recent actions**, updated continuously as you edit.

Examples of tracked events:

- Moved node
- Connected nodes
- Disconnected connections
- Added or removed blocks

This helps you understand what changed and when—especially useful for debugging complex flows.

# **Tips for Using the Canvas Tools Effectively**

- Switch to **Hand Mode** when reviewing flows; switch back to **Pointer Mode** to edit.
- Use **Organize Nodes** after large edits to regain clarity.
- Export your canvas before major redesigns as a visual backup.
- Watch the **Change History** to verify your adjustments.
- Rely on **Undo/Redo** instead of manually fixing mistakes.

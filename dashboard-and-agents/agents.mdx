Agents are the core of your Phonely workspace. Each agent represents a virtual assistant that can manage calls, collect data, and automate workflows using custom call flows, knowledge sources, and integrations.

This guide explains how to **create**, **duplicate**, and **manage agents**, as well as how organizations, workflows, and phone numbers fit together in the Phonely ecosystem.

### Understanding Agents in Phonely

Each **Agent** in Phonely acts as an independent assistant with its own:

- **Primary phone number** – the number used to handle incoming and outgoing calls.
- **Call workflows** – logic and conversation paths unique to that agent.
- **Knowledge base** – information the agent uses to answer questions and make decisions.
- **Guidelines** – instructions for how the agent should behave and respond.
- **Settings** – configurations for integrations, notifications, and post-call actions.

Agents operate **independently** under an organization, meaning workflows and data are **not shared across agents** unless explicitly duplicated.

### Creating a New Agent

You can create a new agent from scratch to handle a specific business area or campaign.

1. From the **left sidebar**, click **Create Agent**.
2. In the **New Agent** modal, choose **Create**.
3. Enter a name for your new agent (e.g., _Support Agent_, _Finance Assistant_).
4. Select the **Organization** this agent belongs to.

<Tip>
  If you have multiple organizations, pick the one that owns the phone number and associated data
</Tip>

5. Click **Create**.

Your new agent will appear in the agent list on the left, ready for configuration.

### Duplicating an Existing Agent

Duplicating an agent allows you to quickly reuse an existing setup — including workflows, integrations, and voice settings — without rebuilding from scratch.

1. Click **Create Agent**.
2. In the modal, select the **Duplicate** option.
3. Choose the **Agent** you want to duplicate from the dropdown list.\
   _(For example, duplicate “Phonely” or “LegalAgent” if they already have a configured workflow.)_
4. Select the **Organization** to assign the duplicate agent under.
5. Click **Duplicate**.

Phonely will duplicate the selected agent and append the name (copy) and inherit:

- The existing workflows.
- The voice and behavior settings.
- Any knowledge base sources or guidelines from the original.

You can then modify the duplicated agent independently — e.g., assign a new number, tweak prompts, or change post-call actions.

### Assigning Phone Numbers

Each agent is assigned **one primary phone number**.\
This number is unique to the agent and determines how calls are routed and tracked.

- When creating a new agent, a number can be automatically assigned.
- You can later configure or change the number under the **Settings** tab of that agent.
- All call logs, transcripts, and reports are tied to that number and its workflows.

### Workflows are Agent-Specific

Each agent manages its own **call flows**. That means the Greeting Messages, Conditional Blocks, Redial configurations, and Post Call actions belong **only** to that specific agent.

#### Example:

- Your **LegalAgent** may have a workflow that gathers caller details and emails them to the legal team.
- Your **support** agent might have a different flow that sends call data to Make via webhook.

Even if the structure looks similar, these workflows are stored separately.\
You can, however, **duplicate** an existing workflow from one agent to another using the **Duplicate Agent** feature.

### Managing Knowledge Bases and Guidelines

Each agent can have its own **Knowledge Base** and **Guidelines** to refine how it handles calls.

- **Knowledge Base:**\
  Upload or connect documents and resources the agent can use to answer customer questions.
- **Guidelines:**\
  Define tone, personality, and behavior (e.g., “Be polite but concise” or “Always verify customer identity first”).

These customizations ensure each agent operates according to the department’s goals — for example, a legal agent may use compliance-related documents, while a support agent references FAQs.

### Organizations and Their Importance

Organizations are the **top-level structure** in Phonely.\
They group multiple agents, workflows, and data under one account.

#### Benefits of Using Organizations:

- **Centralized management:** All agents, numbers, and billing are linked under one organization.
- **Access control:** You can manage which team members can view or edit specific agents.
- **Separation of departments:** Keep distinct data for teams (e.g., Support vs. Legal vs. Sales).
- **Consistent settings:** Shared integrations, compliance rules, and call analytics live under the same organization.

If you work with multiple clients or brands, creating a **separate organization** for each ensures data isolation and easier management.

### Editing Agent Settings

Once your agent is created, open it to access these sections:

- **Agent Design** – Customize call flows, redial logic, and post-call actions.
- **Knowledge Base** – Manage uploaded documents or connected data sources.
- **Settings** – Adjust integrations, notifications, and assigned phone numbers.
- **Guidelines** – Fine-tune tone, compliance, and behavior preferences.

Each section ensures your agent performs consistently and aligns with your organization’s goals.

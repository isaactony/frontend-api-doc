Your Phonely **Account Settings** page is where you manage personal details, security preferences, notification settings, and organization access.\
From here, you can update your profile, invite team members, adjust how often you receive email notifications, and control your organization’s shared settings.

### **Accessing Your Account Settings**

1. Click your **profile icon** (bottom-left corner of the dashboard).
2. From the dropdown menu, select **Settings**.
3. You’ll be directed to the **Account Settings** page, where you’ll find sections for:
   - Personal details (name, email, phone number, API key, UID)
   - Password reset
   - Email preferences
   - Organization settings (members, organization name, billing, and permissions)

## 1. Changing Your Password

If you ever need to update your password or recover access, Phonely allows you to reset it securely via email.

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Change your password** section.
2. Click **Set a new password**.
3. A reset email will be sent to your registered address.
4. Open the email from **phonely** and click **Change Password**.
5. Follow the link to create and confirm your new password.

> **Note:**\
> If the email lands in your spam folder, click **Report not spam** to whitelist future Phonely messages.

## **2. Inviting Team Members**

Invite team members to collaborate within your Phonely organization. Each member can access shared agents, call flows, analytics, and configurations.

2. Under **Members**, locate the input field labeled _Invite a new member to your team by email_.
3. Enter the teammate’s email address.
4. Click **Invite**.

> **Tip:**\
> You can also share a join link by clicking **Share Link** beside the Invite button.\
> Organization owners can assign roles (Owner, Admin, Member) to control permissions.

## **3. Updating Email Preferences**

Phonely lets you control how often you receive email notifications about activity, reports, and system updates.

#### **Steps**

1. Go to the **Email Preferences** section on your Settings page.
2. Open the dropdown menu labeled _Select an option_.
3. Choose your preferred notification frequency:
   - **Daily** — Receive a summary of activity every day.
   - **Weekly** — Get one email with key metrics each week.
   - **Monthly** — Receive a high-level monthly performance report.

Changes are saved automatically once you make a selection.

> **Note:**\
> Adjusting your email preferences doesn’t affect critical account alerts such as password resets or billing notifications.

## **4. Managing Organization Information**

You can view and update organization-level details such as name, billing account, and data sharing options.

#### **Steps**

1. Under **Organization Information**, you can:
   - Update your **Organization Name**.
   - Verify or change your **Billing Account**.
   - Enable or disable **Public Recordings** for transparency control.
   - Check whether **Agent Version Control** is enabled (this feature will be deprecated soon).

Only organization owners have access to these settings.
